<p>On the 1st the 3rd Battalion marched from
Merville to Laventie, and went into billets vacated
<!--012.png--><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2"></a><span class="pageno">2</span>
by the 2nd Battalion Scots Guards. On the 3rd
it took over the left sector from the 1st Battalion
Scots Guards, with the Battalion Headquarters at
Wangeric Farm. Forty-eight hours in the trenches
followed by forty-eight hours’ rest was the regular
routine for the next fortnight. The trenches in
this sector were in a very good state, and it was
possible, therefore, to go in for refinements and
erect splinter-proof shelters; but the enemy’s
artillery was very active, and expended a great
deal of ammunition on the reserve trenches and
communications. During this fortnight a troop
of Wiltshire Yeomanry was attached to the Battalion
for instruction, and did very well although
it was quite new to trench warfare. On the
12th Colonel Corry relinquished command of the
Battalion, and on the 14th <abbr title="Lieutenant">Lieut.</abbr>-Colonel Jeffreys
took charge of it temporarily, pending the arrival
of Major Sergison-Brooke.</p>

<p>On the 14th the Battalion marched back to
La Gorgue, where it remained in billets for ten
days, after which it returned to Laventie. Great
activity was noticeable behind the enemy’s lines,
and as this might be the prelude to an attack
every precaution was taken. There seemed some
possibility of a gas attack, and special warnings
were conveyed to each company, but although
the enemy’s artillery shelled the strong points in
our line, Elgin Post, Fauquissart Cross Roads, and
Hougoumont Post, no infantry attack was made
by the enemy.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><abbr title="February">Feb.</abbr></p>

<p>On February 1 the 3rd Battalion proceeded to
Merville, where it remained until the 7th, when
it marched to Riez Bailleul. The usual routine
<!--013.png--><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3"></a><span class="pageno">3</span>
of two days in and two days out of the trenches
was observed until the 16th, when it was
relieved by the 9th Battalion Royal Welsh
Fusiliers, and marched back to La Gorgue. The
only incident worth recording during this tour of
duty in the trenches was an unfortunate accident
that happened to Lieutenant R. W. Parker. He
was returning with a patrol early in the morning,
and as he came in over the parapet he slipped, and
fell on a bayonet which penetrated his leg below
the knee. On the 17th Lieutenant W. Champneys
and Second Lieutenant G. D. Jackson arrived,
and on the 19th the Battalion marched to Eecke.
The following day it proceeded to Wormhoudt,
where it remained for two days, and then marched
to Poperinghe.</p>

<p class="sidenote">March.</p>

<p>Major-General G. Feilding gave a lecture to
the officers on March 1, and impressed on them
the importance of making the line north of Hooge
strong and defensible, since it was the left flank
of the whole British line. This could be done
only by ingenious concealment of any new work
and by unremitting efforts of all ranks. He
added that, if the enemy concentrated opposite
the Ypres salient, a withdrawal would be made
to the Canal line. Any ground that could not be
held against the enemy’s artillery fire would be
defended by strong points and machine-guns
concealed in natural features, and placed apart
from entrenchments and other works.</p>

<p>On the 5th the 3rd Battalion proceeded to
Calais, and marched to Camp Beaumarais, where
it remained until the 18th. Here a most unfortunate
bombing accident occurred. <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 4
<!--014.png--><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4"></a><span class="pageno">4</span>
Company bombers were practising under Lieutenant
L. Hermon-Hodge behind a thick sand-bag
wall, when a bomb exploded prematurely on
leaving the thrower’s hand. Five men were killed
and sixteen wounded in addition to Lieutenant
Hermon-Hodge himself, who received fragments of
the bomb in his right arm. On the 18th the 3rd
Battalion left Calais, and went by train to Cassel,
where it detrained and marched to Oudezeele.</p>

<p>On the 26th it reached the Ypres salient, and
went into the support trenches. <abbr title="Lieutenant">Lieut.</abbr>-Colonel
Sergison-Brooke was on leave, and the Battalion
was commanded by Major Maitland. Special
precautions with regard to gas were taken, and on
the wind becoming favourable it was arranged
that the Brigade would send the message “Gas
alert,” when all sentries would be doubled, and
men would be placed at the entrance of each dug-out
to give the alarm. Warnings were also
issued with regard to the aeroplanes, which required
careful watching, since the enemy in that
sector was very active, and if any movement was
seen on the Canal bank or in the town shelling
immediately began. During the sixteen days the
Battalion spent at Ypres there were a certain
number of casualties, and the number of sick
increased slightly.</p>

<p>On the 30th the 3rd Battalion had to relieve
the Scots Guards under very trying conditions,
for not only was the front line being shelled,
but the communication trenches were also included
in the bombardment. The three leading
companies succeeded in reaching the front line
without casualties, but <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 2, under Captain
<!--015.png--><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5"></a><span class="pageno">5</span>
Stanhope, came under shrapnel fire as it passed
through Potidje, and had seven casualties.
Communication between the Battalion Headquarters
and the companies was cut, and there
was considerable difficulty in transmitting the
orders. The leading companies, which were
ordered to hold from Duke Street to Roulers
railway, found the front trenches devastated
and swept by shrapnel fired both frontally and
obliquely from Pilkem and Belleward ridge. The
1st Battalion Scots Guards had suffered considerably
and was in great difficulties, as communication
along the front line was impossible
under cover. Men were cut off from the remainder
of their company and were covered with mud and
debris, some even being buried. Relieving a battalion
under such conditions required time, and it
was not till 4 <span class="sc small">A.M.</span> that the relief was complete.</p>

<p>In view of the probability of an attack while
the relief was being carried out, three batteries
of 18-pounder guns were ordered to put down a
barrage on the German front line. This proved
to be a great help, and no doubt prevented
the 3rd Battalion from suffering as heavy losses
as the Scots Guards. There were in all five
men killed and sixteen wounded, in addition
to Captain R. Wolrige-Gordon, whose leg was
grazed by a bullet. The front line was wrecked,
but by placing men in the wreckage under what
cover there was the trench was made defensible.
The enemy, however, showed no signs of life, and
the following days were quiet. Meanwhile it
was found difficult to drain the trenches, which
were in a very dilapidated condition after the
<!--016.png--><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6"></a><span class="pageno">6</span>
bombardment. The whole ground was cut up, and
water stood in the shell-holes, while the wooden
revetments had been torn to pieces and buried
beneath the parapets and parados. The work of
clearing away the debris was necessarily slow, and
the water could not be got rid of in spite of the
good fall in the ground towards Belleward Beer.
At first it was impossible to go down the front
line for more than a few yards, but after two days’
hard work the trench was so far improved that
men could crawl along it, although not without
difficulty. <span class="sidenote">April.</span>On April 3, instead of returning to
Ypres, the 3rd Battalion went into camp just
west of Vlamertinghe.</p>

<p>The officers of the 3rd Battalion at that time
were:</p>

After four days’ rest the 3rd Battalion returned
to the same line of trenches it had occupied
before, and found them worse than ever. The
Scots Guards who had been there had again been
subjected to a severe bombardment, and all the
work that had been done was now obliterated.
On the 4th Lieutenant Worsley left to take up
his appointment as Trench Mortar Officer. The
four days spent in the trenches proved to be very
quiet, as the Germans seemed to have expended
all their shells on the Scots Guards, and nothing
of any interest occurred. On the 11th the Battalion
moved to Poperinghe, where most unfortunately
four men were killed and two wounded
whilst unloading the officers’ kits. On the 12th
Captain Wolrige-Gordon rejoined, his wound not
having proved very serious, and Second Lieutenant
M. Thrupp arrived. Two days later
Captain A. K. Mackenzie, Captain W. A. L.
Stewart, and Second Lieutenant F. J. Heasman
joined the Battalion.</p>

<p>The system of reliefs was changed at this time in
order to avoid the inconvenience of two brigades
relieving on the same night. The tour of duty
was divided as follows: five days at Ypres, five
days in the front line, three days at Camp B,
three days in the front line. On the 18th the
3rd Battalion moved up into Ypres, and went
into support trenches. The men were provided
with steel helmets, and left their service caps with
the transport and their unnecessary kit in sand-bags
at the prison. On the 24th they relieved
the 1st Battalion Scots Guards in the front line,
where the trenches proved to be fairly good,
<!--018.png--><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8"></a><span class="pageno">8</span>
although there was still a lot of water standing
everywhere. As the ground was so much cut up,
the draining of the trenches was not easy; and
since any movement during the day was impossible,
all the work had to be done at night.
Lieutenant Thrupp was knocked down by a shell
during these operations, but was fortunately
unhurt, and there were a few casualties every
day. On the 29th the 3rd Battalion was relieved
by the 1st Battalion Scots Guards, and retired
to B Camp near Vlamertinghe.</p>

<p class="sidenote">May.</p>

<p>On May 1 Second Lieutenant M. Duquenoy
arrived, and was appointed Transport Officer.
The Battalion returned to the trenches on the
2nd, when the relief was carried out in most
favourable circumstances. The three days in the
front line were uneventful, although the patrols
reported great activity in the enemy’s lines, and
the time was spent in draining operations and in
wiring and repairing the parapet. A good many
high-explosive shells were sent over by the
enemy’s artillery, which became fairly active
during the third day, but the casualties were
few. On the 5th the Battalion was relieved, and
went by train to Poperinghe where it went into
billets, but it was by no means free from shell-fire,
as the German artillery periodically bombarded
the town.</p>

<p>After a week’s rest it returned to Ypres,
and was employed on nightly fatigues, carrying
wood for mining parties and wiring the support
lines. On the night of the 16th it returned
to the trenches from Duke Street to Roulers
railway, and came in for a good deal of shelling,
<!--019.png--><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9"></a><span class="pageno">9</span>
chiefly behind the lines. The usual work was
continued, but forty yards of the line had been
completely blown in, and accordingly the trench
had to be re-dug. On the 21st the Battalion
returned to Poperinghe after having been relieved
by the 10th Battalion Rifle Brigade, and marched
to Camp N, where it remained till the end of the
month.</p>

<p class="sidenote">June.</p>

<p>On June 1 the 2nd Guards Brigade proceeded
to Volckerinchove, where it marched past <abbr title="Lieutenant">Lieut.</abbr>-General
Lord Cavan, the Corps Commander,
and Major-General G. Feilding, the Divisional
Commander. In order to try a new method of
attack, a complete representation to scale of the
German trenches revetted with sand-bags was
constructed, while the British line was also
roughly indicated. The assault on the German
trenches was then practised on the following
lines: the assault was to take place in five
waves, the fifth wave being a carrying company,
provided by a battalion other than the actual
assaulting battalion. The two leading companies
were to assault in two waves, the second
following about fifty yards in rear of the first.
These two waves were to cross the German front-line
trench without getting into it, and push on
to the objective, roughly speaking, the German
third line. The third wave was to pass over the
German front line and take the German second
line, which was to be consolidated. The fourth
wave was to take and consolidate the German
front line. Strong bombing parties were to be
placed on both flanks of all companies, with
centre bombing parties dispersed roughly opposite
<!--020.png--><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10"></a><span class="pageno">10</span>
the German communication trenches. Bombing
parties of the two leading waves were to establish
blocks in the German communication trenches,
while the bombing parties of the rear waves were
to clear the communication trenches forward and
get into touch with the two leading waves. All
the men were to carry two Mills grenades and four
sand-bags, tucked through the web equipment
in front, and every third man was to carry a
shovel slung. The <abbr title="Royal Engineers">R.E.</abbr> material and trench-mortar
ammunition was to be carried by the
fifth wave. At night the men were to carry
Roman candles to show the position of the waves.
All the battalions in the Brigade carried out this
form of attack, and when they had mastered the
new features it was practised by the Brigade.</p>

<p>On the 14th the 3rd Battalion moved to
Vlamertinghe in motor lorries to relieve the 9th
Canadian Battalion, which had suffered heavy
losses, and remained there for three days, with
one company at Ypres and three companies at
the west end of Zillebeke Lake. On the night
of the 18th it took over from the 1st Battalion
Scots Guards the front trenches in Sanctuary
Wood, and found the whole ground much cut
about by shell-fire. The wire, which the Germans
had put up whilst in occupation of the old British
front line, combined with the natural obstacles,
such as fallen trees and debris, made any approach
on the part of the enemy very difficult. Reconnaissance
proved that the Germans had withdrawn
to their original front line, leaving the old
British line full of dead, equipment, and ammunition.
Over 350 rifles and a large quantity
<!--021.png--><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11"></a><span class="pageno">11</span>
of ammunition were thus collected. Both on
the 19th and 20th the Battalion was subjected to
heavy shelling, and even during the relief suffered
casualties, among whom was Lieut, the <abbr title="Honorable">Hon.</abbr>
H. E. Eaton who was wounded. After a week’s
rest in Camp D, the Battalion took over the left
reserve sub-sector, at the junction of the British
and French armies on the Yser Canal, where it
remained for three days, and on the night of the
30th it went up again into the front line.</p>

<p class="sidenote">July.</p>

<p>During the three days the Battalion was in
these trenches there was a great deal of activity
on the part of the artillery on both sides. Preparation
was being made on our side for an attack
by the Welsh Guards on Morteloje Estaminet,
while the enemy replied by laying down a
heavy barrage over our communication trenches;
but as the men had been withdrawn from the
first trench the casualties of the 3rd Battalion
were not heavy. On the 3rd the Battalion
withdrew into support by the Canal bank, and
returned again to the front line on the 8th.
On the 7th Major Maitland left to take command
of the 1st Battalion, and on the 9th Second
Lieutenant W. W. S. C. Neville arrived. On the
12th the Battalion retired to the Canal bank,
and three days later proceeded to Camp E,
where it remained for ten days. On the 25th it
proceeded to Volckerinchove, and left the Ypres
area. On the 31st it moved down to Le Souich,
where it was employed for a week in digging for
another Division.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><abbr title="August">Aug.</abbr></p>

<p>On August 3 Lieutenant G. F. R. Hirst and
Lieutenant W. A. Stainton joined the Battalion,
<!--022.png--><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12"></a><span class="pageno">12</span>
and on the 6th Second Lieutenant A. H. Penfold
and Second Lieutenant H. <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> J. Williams arrived.
On the 9th His Majesty the King paid an informal
visit to the 2nd Brigade, but there was no actual
inspection or parade. On the 13th the Battalion
went up into the trenches in front of Bertrancourt,
and beyond the usual amount of shelling nothing
of interest occurred. On the 15th Lieutenant
C. G. Gardner and Second Lieutenant G. M.
Cornish joined the Battalion. Two days later
the Battalion went into camp at Sailly-au-Bois,
where it was packed rather closely together;
and when the enemy began shelling that locality
it had to be taken out of the camp and placed
in artillery formation in the fields in rear. The
remainder of the month was spent in training,
during which the Battalion was encamped at
Bus-les-Artois, Amplier Naours, and finally
Morlancourt.</p>

<p>The 4th Battalion began the new year in
billets at Merville, where it remained till the
13th, doing steady drill, route marching, Lewis
gun and bombing practice. On the 1st, Second
Lieutenant B. Burman, Second Lieutenant C. G.
Keith, and Second Lieutenant D. O. Constable
joined the Battalion.</p>

<p>On the 13th it moved up to the trenches in
front of Laventie, and relieved the 2nd Battalion
Irish Guards. There it remained for a fortnight,
spending two days in the trenches, followed
by two days in support billets. In the line it
occupied were certain strong points, A 1 Redoubt,
Flank Post, and Firework Post, and these were
subjected daily to a systematic shelling from
the German artillery. Beyond a few casualties,
nothing of importance occurred until the 25th,
when Captain Sir Robert Filmer was mortally
wounded. He had just left the trenches when
he found he had lost his glasses. Being very
short-sighted, he determined to go back and look
for them, although he was warned that the road
was being heavily shelled at the time. With
that supreme contempt for all shells that had
characterised his whole conduct since he came
out, he rode back when a shell burst close to him,
<!--024.png--><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14"></a><span class="pageno">14</span>
killing his horse and wounding him so severely
that he died the next day.</p>

<p>On the 27th the 4th Battalion returned to
billets at Merville for four days, and on the
<span class="sidenote"><abbr title="February">Feb.</abbr></span>
1st of February took over the Red House line
at Laventie, where it remained until the 15th,
retiring into support billets every two days.
Numerous patrols lay out each night in the
hopes of capturing prisoners, but these ventures
were not attended with any success, and no
prisoners were secured. Heavy shelling of the
front line of trenches continued daily, but
although considerable damage was done to the
parapet the casualties were few. On the 12th
the enemy shelled Dead End Post, and burnt it
to the ground. There were fortunately no men
killed or wounded, but all the rifles, <abbr title="Small Arms Ammunition">S.A.A.</abbr>,
bombs, and rations were destroyed. The same
night Captain Layton sent out one <abbr title="Non Commissioned Officer">N.C.O.</abbr> and
four men, with two <abbr title="Royal Engineers">R.E.</abbr> men carrying a Bangalore
torpedo, which was placed under the German
wire, with its nose against the enemy’s parapet.
After the party had returned in safety the torpedo
was successfully exploded by means of an electric
cable, and our patrols later reported extensive
damage to the enemy’s parapet.</p>

<p>On the 15th the 4th Battalion returned to
billets at Merville, and the next day entrained
at Lestrem for Calais. On arrival at Calais
it marched to a camp at Le Beaumarais, where
the Y.M.C.A. had hot drinks and cakes ready.
The sea air for which the men had come was
somewhat powerful when they arrived, as it
was blowing a gale, and most of the tents were
<!--025.png--><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15"></a><span class="pageno">15</span>
laid flat. In fact, the whole time they were
there the weather was bad, with heavy snow
and hail storms, which made camp life unpleasant.
On the 23rd forty-three officers of
the 1st and 4th Battalions dined together, and
invited General Heyworth to join them. On
the 26th the Battalion went by train to Cassel,
where it detrained and marched to Herzeele. A
great deal of snow had fallen, and the roads were
in a very bad state, which made it difficult for the
transport to move with any rapidity. The men
were billeted in farms round about, and, although
very much scattered, the billets were good.</p>

<p>A new system of parchments, in recognition
of good work done by <abbr title="Non Commissioned Officer">N.C.O.</abbr>’s and men in the
Division, was instituted. These were signed by
the Major-General commanding the Division and
issued to the men, but as there was every danger
of their being lost if carried about, they were
re-collected, and sent through the Regimental
Orderly Room to the men’s relatives. The
infinitesimal number of decorations allotted to
each battalion necessitated some other means of
recognising conspicuous services, and although
it could hardly be said that these parchments in
any way compensated for the lack of decoration,
they at least gave the man the satisfaction of
knowing that his services had been brought to
the notice of the Major-General.</p>

<p>After spending a fortnight at Herzeele the
4th Battalion moved to a camp of huts and
tents near Poperinghe on March 6.
<span class="sidenote">March.</span>
A digging
party 250 strong, under Captain Blundell, was
sent on to work at Ypres, and remained there for
<!--026.png--><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16"></a><span class="pageno">16</span>
three days. On the 15th the whole battalion
went by train to Ypres, where it went into dug-outs,
and on the following day took over the line
of trenches with its right 200 yards north of the
Menin road, and its left on the Roulers railway
by Railway Wood. There it remained until the
27th, retiring every four days into dug-outs at
Ypres, and although it became a mere target
for the German artillery, it had only nineteen
casualties in its first four days in the trenches.</p>

<p>On the 23rd the following officers joined the
Battalion: Lieutenant C. G. Goschen, Second
Lieutenant A. F. Newey, Lieutenant M. F. H.
Payne-Gallwey, and Second Lieutenant J. P.
Bibby. On the 24th Second Lieutenant B. G. H.
Maclear rendered a very good patrol report,
and on the information he gained a further
reconnaissance under his guidance was sent out
the next day, to be followed, if successful, by
a bombing raid. The patrol was unfortunately
seen by the enemy, and a hot fire was opened
on them all down the line. This completely
precluded all possibility of surprise, and consequently
the enterprise was abandoned. That
evening the German artillery heavily shelled the
Canadian trenches on the right, and inflicted
considerable damage. On the 27th the Battalion
returned to Poperinghe, where the men washed
in the Corps baths, and received clean underclothing.</p>

<p>On April 3 the 4th Battalion moved to Camp B
at Vlamertinghe by companies, and on the 8th returned
to the trenches, relieving the 1st Battalion
Grenadiers as right battalion of the left sector of
the Division. There it remained until the 20th,
placing two companies at a time in the front
line. There was a great deal of work to be done
in strengthening and heightening the parapet,
which in some parts was in a lamentable condition.
On the 17th Second Lieutenant M. H.
Ponsonby and Second Lieutenant R. A. Gault
arrived. The enemy was very active in this
sector, and frequent raids occurred. On the 19th
the German artillery began a systematic bombardment
of our first and second lines by way
of a barrage, while they launched an attack
<!--028.png--><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18"></a><span class="pageno">18</span>
somewhat to the left of the line occupied by the
4th Battalion. At first this attack hardly seemed
to affect <abbr title="Numbers">Nos.</abbr> 2 and 3 Companies, which were at
that time in the front trenches, but when a
message arrived from the Brigade-Major to the
effect that the enemy had occupied Wieltje in
front of the 2nd Battalion Scots Guards, which
had held it lightly, it was clear that something
had to be done. It afterwards turned out that
the enemy had made a determined attack on the
Sixth Division, and had taken 600 yards of trench,
while a raiding party had got down the trench
occupied by the Scots Guards. Lieutenant C. G.
Goschen, who was an old hand at this type of
fighting, at once sent a strong patrol, under
Second Lieutenant Maclear, up the trench to
the left to clear up the situation, and if necessary
support the Scots Guards. This manœuvre
proved eminently successful, and, in spite of
the bombs which rained on them the party of
Grenadiers carried all before them. In the meantime
the Scots Guards ejected all the Germans who
had succeeded in penetrating into their trench.
There was necessarily some very stiff fighting, but
although there were 3 men killed and 24 wounded,
of whom 3 died later, the party returned with no
men missing. <abbr title="Lieutenant">Lieut.</abbr>-Colonel Lord Henry Seymour
afterwards attributed the success of the operation
to the coolness and resource displayed by
Second Lieutenant Maclear, Lieutenant Goschen,
and Captain Blundell. He also praised the marked
ability shown by Second Lieutenant Keith and
Second Lieutenant Constable in the control of
their men under very difficult circumstances.</p>

<p><!--029.png--><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19"></a><span class="pageno">19</span>
One particularly gallant act was performed
that night by Private James Grundy, who was
on duty with his telephone under very heavy
fire, when he suddenly discovered that the wire
had been cut by a shell. He at once went out
in the open to mend the wire, although he was
only 120 yards from the enemy, and had hardly
returned when the wire was cut a second time.
Again, without a moment’s hesitation, he went
out to find where the wire was broken. This
time, however, he was severely wounded as he
was engaged in repairing the line, and when
rescued was found still working away in spite of
his wounds. Even then he refused to be taken
out of the trench until he had handed over the
secret code to an officer. Shells, bullets, wounds
made no difference to him: he had his duty
to do, and he meant to do it. For this act of
bravery he was awarded the <abbr title="Distinguished Combat Medal">D.C.M.</abbr></p>

<p>On the 20th the 4th Battalion returned to
Vlamertinghe, where it remained resting for a
week, after which it moved up to Ypres, and
took over the right of the right sector at Rifle
Farm on the 27th for four days.</p>

<p class="sidenote">May.</p>

<p>The Battalion remained at Ypres until the
15th, taking over various portions of the line
every four days. Nothing of interest occurred
until the night of the 3rd, when it was found
that the enemy had undermined our front line.
In order to destroy the enemy’s shaft, our
miners exploded a mine fifteen yards in front of
our trenches. The shock of the explosion was
very great, and the crater that was formed
was roughly 200 feet in diameter and 80 to 100
<!--030.png--><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20"></a><span class="pageno">20</span>
feet deep. The far edge of the crater was about
seventy yards from the enemy’s trenches. Immediately
after the explosion Lieutenant Payne-Gallwey
dashed over with a <abbr title="Non Commissioned Officer">N.C.O.</abbr> and ten men,
and occupied the far edge of the crater to form
a covering party, while Lieutenant Nairn, with
a similar party, occupied the near edge of the
crater, and commenced placing previously-filled
sand-bags in position to form some cover while
digging. Each of these parties took with them
long ropes, which proved of the greatest assistance
in keeping the men together and showing the line
along which they were to dig. One man shot in
the chest fell half-way down the crater, and was
pulled up with this rope.</p>

<p>While the consolidation of the crater was in
progress, Captain Layton determined to link up
the wire entanglements and bring them round in
front of the crater. He despatched another party
from his company for this purpose, and ordered
them to report themselves to Lieutenant Payne-Gallwey,
but as the enemy was clearly visible,
when the lights went up, the erection of barbed wire
entanglements within seventy yards of their
line was perilous work. The wiring of the crater,
however, was successfully accomplished, although
the enemy threw a quantity of bombs. Fortunately
most of them pitched short, but seven
casualties occurred from splinters. Meanwhile
Lieutenant H. H. Sloane-Stanley on the right sent
out similar wiring and digging parties from <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 2
Company to join up with <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 3 Company, and
the two parties had got within thirty yards of
each other when they were discovered by the
<!--031.png--><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21"></a><span class="pageno">21</span>
Germans, and a storm of bullets from the enemy’s
machine-guns put an end to the work. The
trench between the two companies had, however,
been finished, and as there was no immediate
hurry about the wire, the parties were withdrawn.</p>

<p>General Heyworth the next day, in a letter
reporting the incident, wrote:</p>

<p class="blockquote">I personally inspected the crater this morning and
was enabled to walk through the trench which was
dug, and which now connects H.17 to H.19. The work
done last night reflects the greatest credit on those
officers and men who took part in it, more especially
on the wiring party, who for some time had to work
under the most trying circumstances, as the Germans
turned a machine-gun on them. It was in this party
that all the casualties occurred. The Officer Commanding
the 4th Battalion Grenadier Guards must also
be congratulated on the excellent arrangements made.
The defence of this sub-sector has been considerably
strengthened by this trench.</p>

<p>This was the last time General Heyworth
saw the 4th Battalion, for he was killed on the
9th whilst going round the trenches of the 1st
Battalion Grenadiers.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_1" id="fnanchor_1"></a><a href="#footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></span></p>

<p>On the 18th the 4th Battalion retired to
Poperinghe by train, and on the 19th marched
to Wormhoudt, and remained there till the end
of the month, going into the trenches in various
parts of the line, where it was continually under
shell-fire, but nothing of interest appears to
have happened.</p>

<p class="sidenote">June.</p>

<p>On June 1 the 4th Battalion moved to Poperinghe
<!--032.png--><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22"></a><span class="pageno">22</span>
again, and was employed on fatigues and
digging. On the 5th Second Lieutenant J. B. M.
Burke and Second Lieutenant C. S. Nash arrived,
and on the 7th the Battalion marched to Honbeghem.
The next day after a march of fifteen
miles, it moved to Tatinghem, and on the 17th
returned to Poperinghe. These were two long,
hot marches, but no man fell out on the line of
march either day. On the 18th the Battalion
moved up to the Canal Bank at Ypres, and then
back into the trenches on the right of R sector,
with the Battalion Headquarters at Irish Farm.
The line was very much disconnected, and consisted
chiefly of a chain of posts, most of which
were in bad order, while what trenches there were,
were mostly derelict, and required a good deal of
work. On the 28th Lieutenant H. H. Sloane-Stanley
took out a patrol with the object of
capturing an enemy post, but it was surprised
by one of the enemy’s patrols, which opened fire
on it, wounding every man in the left party of
the patrol. One wounded man was left behind
when the party retired, and although Lieutenant
Sloane-Stanley, Lance-Corporal Holland, and
Private Heap returned and searched for him, he
was never found.</p>

<p class="sidenote">July.</p>

<p>After four very wet days in the trenches the
4th Battalion retired to Ypres for four days’
rest, and on the 4th returned for two nights to
the trenches. The days spent in the trenches
proved uneventful, but on the 7th a raid was
made on a part of the enemy’s line known as the
Canadian Dug-outs. A party under Lieutenant
H. H. Sloane-Stanley and Second Lieutenant
<!--033.png--><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23"></a><span class="pageno">23</span>
D. O. Constable was sent out, and crawled up
quite close to the enemy’s position. Unfortunately
the ground was very wet and muddy, and
this made a noiseless advance a matter of some
difficulty. There seems no doubt that the enemy
heard it, and took precautions. The barrage
was timed to commence at 1.5 <span class="sc small">A.M.</span>, and this
was to be the signal for the assault. At 1 <span class="sc small">A.M.</span>
the Battery covering the Twentieth Division on
the right opened fire, and the raiding party
mistook this for their barrage. Immediately
Lieutenant Sloane-Stanley and Second Lieutenant
D. O. Constable sprang to their feet, and were
about to lead the assault when they found themselves
confronted at fifteen paces by a party of
the enemy who opened a sharp fire on them.
Fortunately the shooting was very wild, and
only four men were wounded. The fighting
then resolved itself into a bombing and Lewis-gun
contest, but the Grenadiers were well
hidden and suffered no loss. Lieutenant Sloane-Stanley’s
orders were not to assault unless it
could be done by surprise, and he therefore
decided to withdraw his party four at a time,
covered by the Lewis gunners, who behaved
with great coolness. So successfully did they
cover the retreat that the whole party returned
without loss. This raid alarmed the enemy, who
opened a heavy bombardment on our line, during
which 4 men were killed and 18 wounded, in
addition to Captain M. Chapman, who was struck
by splinters of a shell in the leg and hand.</p>

<p>On the 8th the Battalion retired to Poperinghe,
and on the 10th Second Lieutenant L. R. Abel-Smith
<!--034.png--><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24"></a><span class="pageno">24</span>
joined the Battalion. The first anniversary
of the formation of the Battalion was
celebrated on the 15th in a befitting manner,
and a programme suitable for the occasion was
carried out. At the men’s dinners at 12.30 free
beer and extra vegetables were issued. In the
afternoon there was a football match between
the right half and left half battalions, followed
at 5 <span class="sc small">P.M.</span> by a sergeants’ and corporals’ dinner,
At 6.15 there was a Battalion concert, after
which the officers had a dinner. Lord Cavan,
who attended the football match, gave away the
prizes, and afterwards addressed the Battalion.
He visited the <abbr title="Non Commissioned Officer">N.C.O.</abbr>’s at dinner, and made them
a short speech on the work done by the Division,
giving especial praise to the Battalion for its
initiative in raids and patrols. Major-General
G. Feilding and Brigadier-General C. Corkran
attended the officers’ dinner.</p>

<p>That night the 4th Battalion moved up again
into the line, and became the right reserve Battalion,
<abbr title="Numbers">Nos.</abbr> 1 and 2 Companies going into dug-outs
on the canal bank, and <abbr title="Numbers">Nos.</abbr> 3 and 4 remaining at
Château Elverdinghe, which was a large and comfortable
house with a park and gardens. The
shelling was continuous, and even back at the
Château the shells fell at times in large numbers.
On the 19th “a dummy raid” was carried
out with the object of surprising the enemy
with artillery fire when he expected an infantry
attack. All the usual preparations for an attack
were gone through, and at 12.30 <span class="sc small">A.M.</span> our guns,
assisted by the Belgian artillery, opened an
intense bombardment for three minutes on a
<!--035.png--><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25"></a><span class="pageno">25</span>
selected portion of the enemy’s front line, while
the infantry indulged in a rapid fire supplemented
by Lewis guns. After three minutes the fire
was lifted on the enemy’s second and third lines,
following the procedure observed when an infantry
attack was about to be launched. It was then
hoped that the Germans would come out of their
dug-outs and man their trenches in order to
repel the attack. The artillery at once shortened
their range, and gave the front German trenches
a sound shelling. The result of this manœuvre
was of course unknown, but judging by the very
feeble reply made by the enemy, the ruse must
have been fairly successful.</p>

<p>Second Lieutenant G. H. T. Paton joined the
Battalion on the 23rd, and Second Lieutenant
A. C. Flower on the 24th. Nothing of interest
occurred during the days the Battalion was in
the trenches until the 26th, when a party of the
enemy raided <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 2 Company trench. About
half-a-dozen Germans suddenly got in over the
parapet and bombed a working party, which was
completely taken by surprise. Second Lieutenant
Maclear, hearing the bombing, rushed to
the spot, and was instantly killed by a bomb
thrown at close quarters. But the German
occupation of the trench was only momentary,
for bombing parties soon arrived from the right
and left, and ejected the raiders, who did not
wait but made their escape as fast as they could
in the darkness. Second Lieutenant Maclear
was an officer who could be ill spared, as he had
proved himself to be absolutely fearless and
self-reliant, and his loss was felt by every one
<!--036.png--><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26"></a><span class="pageno">26</span>
in the Battalion. Captain Layton was hit in
the foot during the repulse of the enemy’s raid,
and Sergeant Aiers, senior sergeant of the Battalion,
was wounded for the third time.</p>


<p>The Guards Division now left the Ypres area
and moved down farther south by easy stages.
Having been relieved by the 1st Battalion Hampshire
Regiment, the 4th Battalion Grenadiers
marched to Poperinghe, where they entrained for
Bollezeele and then marched to Millain.
<span class="sidenote"><abbr title="August">Aug.</abbr></span>
During
the first fortnight in August they moved <i>via</i> Bollezeele,
Millain, Arqueves, Mailly-Mallet to the line
of trenches at Beaumont-Hamel. On the 7th
Lieutenant J. F. J. Joicey-Cecil and Second Lieutenant
R. Y. T. Kendall arrived, and on the
18th Captain C. Mitchell, Lieutenant R. Farquhar,
and Second Lieutenant J. W. F. Selby-Lowndes
joined the Battalion. The four days spent in
the trenches at Beaumont-Hamel proved uneventful,
although there was a good deal of
shelling in addition to the Minenwerfers. On
the 19th the Battalion started off for the Somme
area, but this necessitated going a long way
round by Vauchelles, Gezaincourt, Vignacourt
to Ville. Here it rested for ten days, and on
September 8 moved to Carnoy. On August 31
Captain E. G. Spencer-Churchill joined the
Battalion.</p>

<h4 class="h4head">THE BATTLE OF THE SOMME</h4>

<p class="p2 unindent"><span class="sc">A new stage</span>, and a very distinct and important
stage, in the Allied operations in the West was
marked by the battle of the Somme.</p>

<p>It was at last understood, in the summer of
1916, that spasmodic attacks on the German
trenches did little to gain any real and comprehensive
success, and that, in order to prevent
the enemy moving his reserves from one front to
another, a simultaneous assault by all the Allies
was necessary.</p>

<p>In accord with this view the Allies at the
beginning of the year accepted the principle of
an offensive campaign, and as the objective for
the British and French advance Sir Douglas Haig
and General Joffre selected the Somme area.
All idea of “breaking through” had by now
been abandoned. Such a thing was no longer
regarded as possible in the West, and the plan
adopted was one more suited to modern conditions
of war and more economical of human
life. The objects of the offensive were to relieve
Verdun, to prevent the transfer of German
troops elsewhere, and to wear down the resistance
of the enemy on the Western front.</p>

<p><!--038.png--><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28"></a><span class="pageno">28</span>
Conditions had changed, too, in other ways.
The British Army had been slowly gaining
strength, and the old Army had given place to
the new. There were now fifty divisions in the
field. At the same time, the supply of ammunition
had been steadily increasing, and, thanks
to the patriotism of the trade unions and the
splendid performances of the workers, immense
quantities of guns and shells were pouring into
France. Consequently there was no reason why
a general attack should not be made on the
Western front, although, as Sir Douglas Haig
pointed out in his despatch, he considered it
advisable to postpone it as long as possible.</p>

<p>During the gigantic battle, which began on
July 1 and lasted till November 18, the fighting
was continuous. The German positions were
amazingly strong. First came a network of
trenches, well provided with bomb-proof shelters
and protected in front by wire entanglements,
many of which were in two belts forty yards
broad and built of iron stakes, interlaced with
barbed wire, often as thick as a man’s finger.
Behind these lines the enemy’s strongholds had
been reinforced with every device of military
ingenuity&mdash;woods and villages turned into fortresses,
cellars filled with machine-guns and
trench mortars, dug-outs connected by elaborate
passages. The enormous power of modern
weapons of defence had been used to the utmost.
In fact, the whole line was as nearly impregnable
as Nature, art, and the unstinted labour of close
on two years could make it. And undoubtedly
the Germans believed it impregnable.</p>

<p><!--039.png--><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29"></a><span class="pageno">29</span>
The first phase of the battle took place at the
beginning of July, and although the attacks in
the northern sector were unsuccessful, the armour
was pierced; while in the south our troops
secured Mametz, Montauban, Fricourt, Contalmaison,
and Trônes Wood. On July 14 and the
three following days, the capture of the enemy’s
second line on a front of three miles gave us
possession of the main plateau between Delville
Wood and Bazentin-le-Petit.</p>

<p>The long and severe struggle, which was the
second phase, began on July 18 and culminated
on September 15 with the fall of Ginchy, after
Pozières, Delville Wood, Guillemont, Falfemont
Farm, and Leuze Wood had been taken in
succession. But although the main ridge from
Delville Wood to the road above Mouquet Farm
was secured, Morval on the right and Thiepval
on the left remained in German hands.</p>

<p>In the third phase Flers, High Wood, Martinpuich,
Courcelette, and the Quadrilateral came
into our hands one after another, and on September
25 Morval, Lesbœufs, and Gueudecourt were
secured by the British Army, while the French
took Combles. During October Thiepval was
taken, and also Eaucourt l’Abbaye and Le Sars,
while in November, as the outcome of an advance
on both sides of the Ancre, we captured <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Pierre
Divion, Beaucourt, and Beaumont-Hamel.</p>

<p>Thus all our principal objects were achieved,
in spite of the fact that the Germans were able
to mass more than half their army upon this
part of their front. The British Army took
38,000 prisoners, including over 800 officers; also
<!--040.png--><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30"></a><span class="pageno">30</span>
29 heavy guns, 96 field-guns and field-howitzers,
136 trench mortars, and 514 machine-guns.</p>

<p>The battle was marked by the sudden appearance
of the Tanks. So well had their secret been
kept that until they came upon the battlefield the
Germans had no idea of their existence. “The
Machine-gun Corps, Heavy Section” was the
official title of these heavy armoured cars which
could move anywhere, over trenches and through
wire entanglements, pushing down walls and
even houses; they contained a garrison of six
men with machine-guns and 6-<abbr title="pounder">pdr.</abbr> guns. So
many legends had grown up of their supernatural
powers that their actual début caused a
certain disappointment. But although in some
parts of the battlefield they failed us, some of
them did wonders, and many of the strongholds
in the German line could never have been taken
without their help.</p>

<p>The net result of the battle was a brilliant
victory for the British Army, for not only was a
large tract of ground captured from the enemy,
but the three objects which we had set out to
gain were fully attained. Verdun was relieved
of pressure, the main portion of the German
Army was detained on the Western front, and a
crippling blow was struck at the enemy forces.
It was clearly shown that, on anything like equal
terms, the British could drive back the German
Army, sheltered even by the strongest entrenchments.</p>

<p>As the area and duration of modern battles
are immense, a long time naturally elapses
before their effects are felt by the losing side.
<!--041.png--><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31"></a><span class="pageno">31</span>
Formerly battles lasted only a few days, and
their results were seen immediately in the retirement
of the beaten army. After the battle of
the Somme, however, nothing happened at first,
and it was not until six months later that the
Germans found that their positions had become
untenable, and a general retirement was advisable.</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="sc">The Guards Division at the Somme</span></p>

<p class="p1 sidenote"><abbr title="September">Sept.</abbr></p>

<p class="p1">Nothing has ever been done by battalions of
the Guards finer than the part they took in the
battle of the Somme. It was not until the
beginning of September that the Guards Division
arrived in the Somme area, so it was not present
at the first two phases of the battle. But in
the attacks of September 15 and 25 the men
covered themselves with glory; their discipline
and coolness under fire were magnificent, and
they captured lines which had up to then been
considered impregnable. The final assault of
Lesbœufs was one of the most successful operations
of the war.</p>

<p>Not only were the staff arrangements admirable,
but the co-operation between infantry and
artillery proved in every way perfect. Against
the unflinching attack of the Division nothing
could stand; the mass of shells poured over by
the German artillery, the hail of bullets from
their machine-guns, and the rifle-fire of their
infantry in the trenches, were all powerless to
check it. The men were splendid: it made not
a scrap of difference whether they had officers
or not, whether they were with their own units or
<!--042.png--><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32"></a><span class="pageno">32</span>
mixed up with other regiments. Nothing could
stop them. When the 3rd Brigade went up, the
battle had already been raging for over two
months; and the Germans were then busily but
vainly carrying out counter-attacks, in the hope
of re-taking some of the ground that had been
wrested from them. Consequently the two battalions
sent forward came in for some very stiff
fighting, especially the Welsh Guards, who went
through some anxious moments owing to the
advanced position they were occupying. They
were fiercely attacked by large bodies of the
enemy, but, with the help of one company of the
1st Battalion Grenadiers, managed to hold their
own. Meanwhile the 4th Battalion Grenadiers&mdash;the
other battalion sent up from the 3rd Brigade&mdash;held
an uncomfortable position near the Quadrilateral,
to the right and in rear of the Welsh
Guards.</p>

<p>Parts of the line had also to be straightened,
and “pockets” of Germans to be cleared away
before the general attack of the 15th; and for
this task were detailed those battalions from the
1st and 2nd Brigades which would not be in the
front line on the 15th. There were some closely-contested
bombing fights, supported by artillery, in
the parts of the line that needed straightening, and
these operations were all successfully carried out.</p>

<p>On the 12th Major-General G. Feilding issued
the following orders:</p>

<div class="medium">
<p class="p2 center"><span class="sc">The Guards Division Order, <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 76</span></p>

<p class="p1">1. The Fourth Army will attack the enemy’s defences
between Combles Ravine and Martinpuich on Z day
<!--043.png--><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33"></a><span class="pageno">33</span>
with the object of seizing Morval, Lesbœufs, Gueudecourt,
and Flers, and to break through the enemy’s
system of defence.</p>

<p>The French are undertaking an offensive simultaneously
on the South and the Reserve Army on the North.</p>

<p>2. The attack will be pushed with the utmost vigour
all along the line until the most distant objectives are
reached. The failure of one unit on the flank is not to
prevent other units pushing on to their final objective,
as it is by such means that those units who have failed
will be assisted to advance.</p>

<p>3. <i>Preliminary Bombardment.</i>&mdash;(<i>a</i>) Commencing on
the 12th September a bombardment and wire-cutting on
the hostile defensive system will take place from 6 <span class="sc small">A.M.</span>
to 6.30 daily.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) The preliminary bombardment on the day of the
attack will be similar to that of previous days, there
being no further increase of fire previous to zero.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) At 6.30 each evening from the 12th September
inclusive night firing will commence, and continue till
6 <span class="sc small">A.M.</span>, lethal shells being used.</p>

<p>4. (<i>a</i>) The Sixth Division is to attack on the right
and the Fourteenth Division on the left.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) The 2nd Guards Brigade will attack on the right
of the Division, the 1st Guards Brigade on the left.
The 3rd Guards Brigade will be in Divisional Reserve.</p>

<p>5. <i>Forming-up Areas.</i>&mdash;Forming-up areas are shown
on attached maps. The 1st and 2nd Guards Brigades
will allot a forming-up area for the 75th and 76th Field
Companies <abbr title="Royal Engineers">R.E.</abbr> respectively in their forming-up areas.</p>

<p>Instructions as to movements of troops to their
forming-up areas will be issued separately.</p>

7. (<i>a</i>) 50 per cent Field Artillery covering the Division
will be used for creeping barrage, and 50 per cent for
stationary barrage.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Details of the stationary barrages will be issued
later. In all cases the stationary barrage will lift back
when the creeping barrage reaches it.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) At zero the creeping barrage will open 100 yards
in front of our front trenches, and will advance at the
rate of 50 yards per minute until it is 200 yards beyond
the first objective, when it will become stationary.
At zero + 1 hour the creeping barrage will become
intense on the line 200 yards in front of first objective,
and will creep forward at the rate of 50 yards per minute
in front of that portion of the 1st Guards Brigade which
is to advance to the second objective.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) At zero + 1 hour and 10 minutes the creeping
barrage will become intense on a line 200 yards in
front of the first objective as far north as T.86.4.6,
thence on a line 200 yards in front of the second objective,
and will advance at the rate of 30 yards per minute until
it has passed 200 yards beyond the third objective,
when it will become stationary.</p>

<p>This barrage is to cover the advance of the tanks.
There will be no creeping barrage in front of infantry
during their advance to third objective, which commences
at zero + 2 hours.</p>

<p>(<i>e</i>) At zero + 3 hours and 30 minutes the creeping
barrage will become intense on a line 200 yards in front
of third objective, and will advance at the rate of
30 yards per minute until it has passed 200 yards beyond
fourth objective, when it will become stationary. This
barrage is to cover the advance of the tanks. There
will be no creeping barrage in front of the infantry
during the advance on the fourth objective, which commences
at zero + 4 hours and 30 minutes.</p>

<p>(<i>f</i>) In the attack on the first and second objectives
gaps of 100 yards wide will be left in the creeping barrage
for the routes of the tanks.</p>

<p><!--045.png--><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35"></a><span class="pageno">35</span>
8. The flow of troops to the 2nd Guards Brigade and
1st Guards Brigade must be maintained so as to ensure
a strong attack being pressed against each successive
objective. Sufficient men will be left in each line
captured to clear it of the enemy. No troops of the
2nd and 1st Guards Brigades will be detailed to remain
behind in objectives after they have been passed for
purposes of consolidation.</p>

<p>The task of the two leading Brigades is to press the
attack through to their ultimate objectives with every
means at their disposal.</p>

<p>9. The 3rd Guards Brigade will advance at zero +
1 hour and 30 minutes until its leading troops reach the
south-western outskirts of Ginchy, when the Brigade
will halt and await orders.</p>

<p>Special instructions as to action of Reserve Brigade
will be issued.</p>

<p>10. Tanks will be employed to operate with the
attack; instructions as to their movements are attached.</p>

<p class="p2">So great was the danger of battalions being
practically annihilated in an attack that orders
had been issued for a certain nucleus of officers
and <abbr title="Non Commissioned Officer">N.C.O.</abbr>’s to be left with the Transport,
whenever a battalion went into action, so as to
make sure of a sufficient number surviving to
carry on the work. Accordingly on this occasion
the Second in Command, the junior Captains of
companies, the Battalion and Company Sergeant-Majors
and Quartermaster-Sergeants in each
battalion were left behind.</p>

<p>At 6.20 on the morning of the 15th the artillery
<!--046.png--><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36"></a><span class="pageno">36</span>
bombardment ceased, and the Guards Division
advanced, preceded by a creeping barrage, with
Pereira’s Brigade on the left and Ponsonby’s
Brigade on the right, while Corkran’s Brigade
remained in reserve. In the front line were the
1st, 2nd, and 3rd Battalions of the Coldstream
and the 3rd Battalion Grenadiers. The advance
of the three Coldstream battalions was a wonderful
sight, and they carried everything before
them, but in their eagerness to reach the enemy
lost direction and went too far to the left. Meanwhile
the 3rd Battalion Grenadiers on the right
kept straight on, so there was a considerable
gap between it and the three battalions of Coldstream.
Coming up through the German barrage,
the 2nd Battalion Grenadiers, which was in
support of the 2nd Coldstream, completely lost
sight of the Coldstream battalions. In accordance
with its orders it advanced with its right on
the Ginchy&mdash;Lesbœufs road, but on reaching
the first objective it found it occupied by the
enemy instead of by the Coldstream, as it
expected, and suffered heavy loss. Under the
impression that it was following in the wake of
the 2nd Battalion Coldstream, it was advancing
in artillery formation, and had to form line when
within a few yards of the enemy’s trench, which
was untouched, as the Coldstream battalions had
passed farther to the left.</p>

<p>When the first objective was secured, the
order from right to left was as follows: the 3rd
Battalion Grenadiers, the 2nd Battalion Grenadiers,
the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Battalion Coldstream.
Between the first two objectives there were
<!--047.png--><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37"></a><span class="pageno">37</span>
several intermediate lines of trenches, all of which
were most confusing for the battalions in front.
The Coldstream battalions mistook these intermediate
lines for objectives, and thought that
they had reached the third objective when they
were really between the first and second objectives.
Their real position, however, was correctly
reported by the air scouts.</p>

<p>Meantime the Quadrilateral&mdash;a powerful system
of redoubts&mdash;on the right had made any advance
by the Sixth Division impossible, and on the left
also the Fourteenth Division had been held up
by some strong points in the enemy’s line. The
result was that the Guards Division had both
flanks in the air, and was subjected to a withering
fire almost from the start. The 3rd Battalion
Grenadiers on the right and the 3rd Battalion
Coldstream on the left were obliged to throw out
protective flanks, and so had some difficulty in
keeping pace with the battalions in the centre.</p>

<p>It was some time before the two brigades were
firmly established in the first objective, as there
were parts of the line in which some Germans had
been left, more especially in the space reserved
for the tanks, which unfortunately never arrived.
However, the 1st and 2nd Battalions Coldstream
in the centre pushed on and gained the second
objective, while the battalions right and left threw
back protective flanks. The second objective was
a trench running into the first objective, and
only concerned the Coldstream battalions on
the left.</p>

<p>On the next day, the 16th, Corkran’s Brigade
was ordered to advance through the leading
<!--048.png--><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38"></a><span class="pageno">38</span>
brigades and continue the attack. But it did
not start till the middle of the day, and after
having gone some distance was held up by
machine-gun fire and the men were told to dig
themselves in where they were.</p>

<p>The whole Division was taken out of the line
on the night of the 18th and remained resting in
bivouacs until the 20th, when each brigade sent
battalions into the front line to dig assembly
trenches and straighten parts of the line. On
the 22nd Major-General G. Feilding issued the
following orders:</p>

<div class="medium">
<p class="p2 center"><span class="sc">Guards Division Order, <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 82</span></p>

<p class="p1">1. (<i>a</i>) The Fourth Army will renew the attack on
Z day in combination with attacks by the French to the
South and the Reserve Army to the North.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) The objectives of the Fourteenth Corps include
Morval and Lesbœufs, and those of the Fifteenth Corps
Gueudecourt.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) The attack of the Fourteenth Corps will be carried
out by the Fifth Division on the right, the Sixth Division
in the centre, and the Guards Division on the left. The
Fifty-eighth Division will form a defensive flank to the
south of the Fifth Division. The Twenty-first Division
will be attacking on our left.</p>

<p>2. The 1st Guards Brigade will attack on the right
and the 3rd Guards Brigade on the left.</p>

<p>The 2nd Guards Brigade (less one Battalion) will be
in Divisional Reserve.</p>

<p>1st Battalion 2nd Guards Brigade will be in Corps
Reserve; 2nd Guards Brigade will notify Divisional
Headquarters the name of the Battalion detailed.</p>

<p>3. <i>Preliminary Bombardment.</i>&mdash;A steady bombardment
of hostile positions will be commenced at 7 <span class="sc small">A.M.</span>
on Z day, and will be continued to 6.30 <span class="sc small">P.M.</span>; it will
recommence at 6.30 <span class="sc small">A.M.</span> on Z day.</p>

<p><!--049.png--><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39"></a><span class="pageno">39</span>
The ground in front and rear of the German trenches
which are being bombarded will be searched occasionally
with 18-<abbr title="pounder">pdr.</abbr> shrapnel and <abbr title="high explosive">H.E.</abbr> shell.</p>

<p>There will be no intensive fire previous to the hour
of zero. Night firing will be carried out nightly between
the hours of 6.30 <span class="sc small">P.M.</span> and 6.30 <span class="sc small">A.M.</span></p>

<p>4. Forming-up areas are shown on the attached map.
The 1st and 3rd Guards Brigades will allot forming-up
areas to the 75th and 55th Field Companies <abbr title="Royal Engineers">R.E.</abbr>
respectively, within their areas.</p>

<p>Instructions for movements to forming-up areas will
be issued separately.</p>

<p>6. The infantry will advance to the attack on the
Green line at zero; to the attack on the Brown line at
zero + 1 hour, and to the attack on the Blue line at
zero + 2 hours.</p>

<p>7. <i>Barrages</i>&mdash;</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) 50 per cent of the Field Artillery covering the
Division will be used for the creeping barrage and
50 per cent for stationary barrage.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) In all cases the stationary barrage will lift when
the creeping barrage meets it.</p>

<p>8. (<i>a</i>) At zero the creeping barrage will commence
100 yards in front of our front trenches. It will advance
at the rate of 50 yards per minute until it is 200 yards
beyond the Green line, when it will become stationary.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) At zero + 1 hour the creeping barrage will commence
200 yards in front of the Green line and will
advance at the rate of 50 yards per minute until it has
passed 200 yards beyond the Brown line, when it will
become stationary.</p>

<p><!--050.png--><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40"></a><span class="pageno">40</span>
(<i>c</i>) At zero + 2 hours the creeping barrage will commence
200 yards in front of the Brown line, and will
advance at the rate of 50 yards per minute until it has
passed 200 yards beyond the Blue line, when it will
become stationary.</p>

<p>9. (<i>a</i>) The task of the two leading Guards Brigades
is to press the attack through to the Blue line. A
sufficient flow of troops must be maintained by the
1st and 2nd Guards Brigades from zero onwards to
ensure that the attack made from the Brown line is
strong and well supported.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Special arrangements must be made to deal with
resistance in Lesbœufs and thus prevent any possibility
of the enemy getting round our troops who have gained
the Blue line.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) The 1st and 3rd Guards Brigades will garrison
and consolidate the Brown line with a portion of their
reserves when the attack goes forward to the Blue line.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) On gaining the Blue line, Battalions will be sent
forward to any ground from which observation can be
gained; such points will be consolidated and eventually
joined up with our line.</p>

<p class="p2">On the 24th the Battalions that were to lead
the attack took their place in the line ready for
the next day. The order of attack was for the
Fifty-sixth Division to form the right flank
guarding Combles, the Fifth Division to capture
Morval, the Sixth Division to occupy the southern
end of Lesbœufs, and the Guards Division to
take Lesbœufs.</p>

<p>In Pereira’s Brigade, which attacked on the
right, the 2nd Battalion Grenadiers and 1st
Battalion Irish Guards were in the front line,
and were supported by the 2nd and 3rd Battalions
Coldstream. In Corkran’s Brigade on the left
the 4th Battalion Grenadiers and 2nd Battalion
<!--051.png--><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41"></a><span class="pageno">41</span>
Scots Guards led, supported by the 1st Battalion
Grenadiers and 1st Battalion Welsh Guards.
The orders of the two brigades differed. In the
1st Guards Brigade the leading battalions were
to take all the objectives, and when they passed
on the battalions in support were to consolidate
each line. In the 3rd Brigade the two leading
battalions were to take the first two objectives
and then throw out a defensive flank; the
battalions in support were then to advance
through them and secure the third objective, one
of these again throwing out a defensive flank.</p>

<p>At 12.35 <span class="sc small">P.M.</span> on the 25th the attack started,
and in spite of the wire, in some places intact, the
first objective was secured. At 1.30 the advance
to the second objective began. The battalions in
front suffered heavily, especially in officers, but
by 1.45 the second objective was in our hands.
All this time the Twenty-first Division on the
left had been held up, and the left flank of the
Guards Division was consequently in the air.
The 4th Grenadiers had therefore to throw out
a defensive flank to the left, which eventually
became so long that not only that battalion but
also the Welsh Guards were employed to guard
it. Major-General Feilding regarded this defensive
flank as of the utmost importance, since
it was from this quarter that a counter-attack
was expected. In some parts of the line the wire
was uncut, and the advance was retarded, but
this did not prevent the objectives being secured
by the times specified in the orders.</p>

<p>As soon as we had gained the second objective,
the 1st Battalion Grenadiers and 1st Battalion
<!--052.png--><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42"></a><span class="pageno">42</span>
Welsh Guards passed through the leading battalions
of Corkran’s Brigade and attacked Lesbœufs,
while the 2nd Battalion Grenadiers and
1st Battalion Irish Guards continued their advance.</p>

<p>Thus with the 4th Battalion Grenadiers on
the defensive flank there were three Grenadier
battalions engaged in the attack on the third
objective. The capture of Lesbœufs itself fell to
the lot of the 1st Battalion, and news was at once
sent back that all the objectives had been secured.
The battalions in front appear to have been so
elated by their success that they asked for the
cavalry to be allowed to go through. But Lord
Cavan, the Corps Commander, realised that it
would be madness to employ cavalry on such a
limited front, and gave orders that the leading
battalions were to consolidate their position.</p>

<p class="p1">Detached from the 1st Guards Brigade on
August 31 the 2nd Battalion Grenadiers had
been sent up to Carnoy to dig in rear of the
Twentieth Division. It returned on September
3rd to Méaulte, where it underwent a thorough
course of training, something in the nature of a
dress rehearsal. Expert bombing officers gave
instruction to every company in the Brigade, so
that each man had an opportunity of learning
the latest developments in bombing. All the
battalions practised deploying in artillery formation,
attacking an imaginary line of trenches,
and then moving on immediately to a second
<!--053.png--><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43"></a><span class="pageno">43</span>
objective. A great deal was learned in the way
of signalling, and trials were made of a system of
organising a single main trunk line, as central
as possible, so as to avoid having a number of
defective lines to each unit. This line was to
consist of telephone or visual or relay posts&mdash;or,
if possible, of all three. Careful consideration
was given to the difficult task of getting the men
across No Man’s Land, and every detail was
rehearsed. Later the whole Brigade was practised
in the attack, and in maintaining constant communication
during an advance.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><abbr title="September">Sept.</abbr> 9.</p>

<p>After a week the 1st Brigade received orders
to proceed to Carnoy, and all surplus kit and
equipment were left behind in store. The 2nd
Battalion Grenadiers marched to Carnoy, and
bivouacked not far from the place where it had
been at the beginning of the month.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><abbr title="September">Sept.</abbr> 11.</p>

<p>On the 11th orders were received for the 1st
Brigade to relieve the left half of the 3rd Guards
Brigade, while the 2nd Guards Brigade was to
take the place of the other half. These orders
(given below) were communicated to commanding
officers at a conference held at Brigade Headquarters.</p>

<p>Brigadier-General Pereira issued the following
orders:</p>

<div class="medium">
<p class="p2 center"><span class="sc">1st Guards Brigade Order, <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 73</span></p>

<p class="p1">1. The Fourth Army will attack the enemy’s defences
between Combles Ravine and Martinpuich on Z day
with the object of seizing Morval, Lesbœufs, Gueudecourt,
and Flers, breaking through the enemy’s system
of defence.</p>

<p>The French are undertaking an offensive simultaneously
<!--054.png--><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44"></a><span class="pageno">44</span>
on the south and the Reserve Army on the
north.</p>

<p>2. The attack will be pushed with the utmost vigour,
all along the line, until the most distant objectives are
reached.</p>

<p>The failure of a unit on a flank is not to prevent
other units pushing on to their final objectives, as it is
by such means that these units, which have failed, will
be assisted to advance.</p>

<p>3. <i>Preliminary Bombardment.</i>&mdash;(<i>a</i>) Commencing on
the 12th September bombardment and wire-cutting on
hostile defensive system will take place from 6 <span class="sc small">A.M.</span> to
6.30 <span class="sc small">P.M.</span> daily.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) The preliminary bombardment on the day of the
attack will be similar to that on previous days, there
being no increase of fire previous to zero.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) At 6.30 <span class="sc small">P.M.</span> each evening from the 12th September
inclusive, night firing will commence and continue till
6 <span class="sc small">A.M.</span> Lethal shells will be used.</p>

<p>4. (<i>a</i>) The 2nd Guards Brigade will attack on the
right of the Division&mdash;the 1st Guards Brigade the left,
and the 3rd Guards Brigade will be in divisional
reserve.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) The 4th Brigade of the Fourteenth Division will
attack on the left of the 1st Guards Brigade.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) Boundaries are shown on attached map.</p>

<p>5. <i>Forming-up Areas.</i>&mdash;Forming-up areas are shown
on attached maps.</p>

<p>Instructions as to movement of troops to their forming-up
areas will be issued separately.</p>

<p>6. Objectives allotted to Guards Brigades and neighbouring

<p class="hanging">To the attack of the Red line at zero + 4 hours and
30 minutes.</p>

<p>8. <i>Artillery Barrages</i>&mdash;</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) 50 per cent of Field Artillery covering the Division
will be used for creeping barrage, and 50 per cent for
stationary barrage.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Details of stationary barrages will be issued later.
In all cases the stationary barrages will lift back when
the creeping barrage reaches it.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) At zero the creeping barrage will open 100 yards
in front of our trenches, and will advance at rate of 50
yards per minute until it is 200 yards beyond the first
objective, when it will become stationary.</p>

<p>At zero + 1 hour the creeping barrage will become
intense on a line 200 yards in front of the first objective,
and will creep forward at rate of 50 yards per minute
in front of that portion of the 1st Guards Brigade which
is to advance to the second objective.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) At zero + 1 hour and 10 minutes the creeping
barrage will become intense on a line 200 yards in front
of the first objective as far north as T.8.b.4.6, thence
on a line 200 yards in front of second objective, and will
advance at rate of 30 yards per minute until it has
passed 200 yards beyond the third objective&mdash;when it
will become stationary.</p>

<p>This barrage is to cover the advance of the tanks.</p>

<p>There will be no creeping barrage in front of the
infantry during their advance to third objective, which
commences at zero + 2 hours.</p>

<p>(<i>e</i>) At zero + 3 hours 30 minutes, the creeping barrage
will become intense on a line 200 yards in front of the
third objective&mdash;and will advance at rate of 30 yards
per minute until it has passed 200 yards beyond fourth
objective, when it will become stationary. This barrage
is to cover the advance of the tanks.</p>

<p>There will be no creeping barrage in front of the
<!--056.png--><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46"></a><span class="pageno">46</span>
infantry during the advance to the fourth objective,
which commences at zero + 4 hours 30 minutes.</p>

<p>(<i>f</i>) In the attack on first and second objectives gaps
of 100 yards wide will be left in the creeping barrage for
the routes of the tanks.</p>

<p>9. The attack will be carried out as follows:</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) The 2nd and 3rd Battalions Coldstream Guards
will attack and capture the first, second, and third
objectives. The dividing line between these battalions
is shown on attached maps.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) The 2nd Battalion Grenadier Guards will move
in rear of the 2nd and 3rd Battalions Coldstream Guards.
When the latter advance to the assault of the second
objective the 2nd Battalion Grenadier Guards will occupy
the first objective until the 1st Battalion Irish Guards
have passed through them; they will then follow and
support them in their attack on the fourth objective.</p>

<p>The rôle of the 1st Battalion Grenadier Guards is to
form a defensive flank, if necessary, and to support the
attack of the 1st Battalion Irish Guards in their attack
on the fourth objective, with such troops as are not
required for a defensive flank.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) 1st Battalion Irish Guards will attack the fourth
objective.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) Machine-gun <abbr title="Company">Coy.</abbr> One section will accompany
each battalion in the assault, and will be under the
orders of the <abbr title="Officer Commanding">O.C.</abbr> Battalion.</p>

<p>(<i>e</i>) Stokes <abbr title="Trench Mortar">T.M.</abbr> Battery. Four guns will accompany
the 2nd Battalion Grenadier Guards in case it is
necessary to form a defensive flank. They will not go
farther than the second objective. They will act under
the orders of the <abbr title="Officer Commanding">O.C.</abbr> Battalion.</p>

<p>The remaining four guns will be in the trench in
which advanced Brigade Headquarters is situated,
S.24.b.6.2.</p>

<p>(<i>f</i>) The 75th Field <abbr title="Company">Coy.</abbr> and the four work platoons
will remain in their forming-up area until further orders
are received.</p>

<p><!--057.png--><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47"></a><span class="pageno">47</span>
10. <i>Formation of Attack.</i>&mdash;The formation for the
carrying out of the attack is shown on attached sketch.</p>

<p>The 2nd Battalion Grenadier Guards and 1st Battalion
Irish Guards will move into line or small columns
according as to whether they are under rifle-fire or not.</p>

<p>11. The flow of troops will be continuous. This is
to ensure a strong attack being pressed against each
successive objective.</p>

<p>Officers commanding battalions will call for support,
if necessary, from the battalions immediately in rear
of them. If necessary, men will be left in each line
captured to clear it of the enemy, but troops will not
be detailed to remain behind in objectives for purposes
of consolidation, except that the 2nd and 3rd Battalions
Coldstream Guards will remain in the third objective
ready to support the troops attacking the fourth
objective.</p>

<p>The task of the Brigade is to press the attack through
to their ultimate objectives with every means at our
disposal.</p>

<p>12. Tanks will be employed to co-operate with the
attack. Instructions as to their employment are
attached.</p>

<p>Instructions will be issued as to movement of tanks
to their departure positions, and as to time of their
advance to the various objectives.</p>

<p>13. <i>Royal Flying Corps</i>&mdash;</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) 9th Squadron, Royal Flying Corps will have
one Contact aeroplane in the air from zero to dark on
Z day, and again from 6.30 <span class="sc small">A.M.</span> to 9 <span class="sc small">A.M.</span> on Z + 1
days.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Flares will be lit as follows:</p>

<p class="hanging">(1) On obtaining each objective.</p>
<p class="hanging">(2) At 12 noon and 5 <span class="sc small">P.M.</span> on Z day by leading troops.</p>
<p class="hanging">(3) At 6.30 <span class="sc small">A.M.</span> on Z + 1 day by leading troops.</p>

<p>Red flares will be used by infantry, Green flares by
Cavalry.</p>

<p><!--058.png--><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48"></a><span class="pageno">48</span>
14. An orderly with a watch will visit all Battalion
<abbr title="Headquarters">H.Q.</abbr> about 1 <span class="sc small">P.M.</span> and 7 <span class="sc small">P.M.</span> on Y day, so that time
may be checked.</p>

<p>15. Special instructions will be issued on the following
subjects:</p>

<p class="hanging">(<i>a</i>) Medical arrangement.</p>
<p class="hanging">(<i>b</i>) Supply of rations, water, <abbr title="Small Arms Ammunition">S.A.A.</abbr>, Light <abbr title="Trench Mortar">T.M.</abbr> ammunition and hand grenades.</p>
<p class="hanging">(<i>c</i>) Communications.</p>

<p>16. All transport will be packed up and ready to
move forward at one hour’s notice after zero + 4 hours.</p>

<p>The Brigade Transport officer will remain at Divisional
Headquarters, Minden Post, from zero + 2 hours onwards.</p>

<p>On Y day after 7.30 <span class="sc small">P.M.</span> the road running north
from cross-roads S.28.d.4.2 will be clear of all wheeled
traffic.</p>

<p>17. As soon as the final objectives have been captured
by the infantry the cavalry will advance and seize the
high ground Rocquigny&mdash;Villers-au-Flos&mdash;Riencourt-les-Bapaume&mdash;Bapaume.</p>

<p>The Fourteenth Corps will be prepared to support
the cavalry on the above line at the earliest possible
moment.</p>

<p>18. Prisoners will be sent <i>via</i> Brigade Headquarters
to Divisional Collecting Station at Crater Post A.8.a.6.3,
where they will be taken over and searched under
A.P.M. arrangements.</p>

<p>Receipts will be given for prisoners and escorts will
return to their units.</p>

<p>All captured documents should be sent with prisoners
to Divisional Collecting Station, whence they will be
forwarded under Divisional arrangements.</p>

<p>19. <i>Dumps.</i>&mdash;<abbr title="Royal Engineers">R.E.</abbr> dumps of sand-bags and wire have

<p>By September 12 the whole Brigade was fully
equipped. To every battalion had been issued
bombs, sand-bags, distinguishing arm-bands,
rockets, flares, wire-cutters, etc., and all that
remained to be done was to fix the hour and the
day of attack.</p>

<p>The 2nd Battalion Grenadiers took over the
left half of the line occupied by the 3rd Guards
Brigade on the night of the 12th, while the 1st
Battalion Irish Guards moved up in support to
Trônes Wood and Bernafay Wood. The 2nd
and 3rd Battalions Coldstream, which were to
carry out the assault, remained resting at Carnoy
till the last moment, and the Brigade Headquarters
moved up to a dummy trench between
Trônes and Bernafay Woods.</p>

<p>The following message from <abbr title="Lieutenant">Lieut.</abbr>-General
Lord Cavan was circulated:</p>

<p class="blockquote">The Corps Commander knows that there are difficulties
to be cleared up on the left and in front of the
1st Guards Brigade, and on the right of the 2nd Guards
Brigade, but the Commander-in-Chief is of opinion that
the general situation is so favourable that every effort
must be made to take advantage of it and that tanks
should carry out a special programme before zero to
deal with these unsatisfactory positions. The Commander-in-chief
states that there were only two German
divisions in reserve on a large front, and that one of
<!--062.png--><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50"></a><span class="pageno">50</span>
     them had recently had enormous casualties, and the
other heavy casualties.</p>

<p class="blockquote">The French operations yesterday have been most
successful, and they have captured Bouchavesnes, which
was their objective.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><abbr title="September">Sept.</abbr> 13.</p>

<p>Next night the 2nd Battalion Grenadiers,
which was holding the northern sector of the
Ginchy line, was instructed to go out and
straighten the line, so that the battalions which
were to attack on the following day should not
be held up at the very start. <abbr title="Lieutenant">Lieut.</abbr>-Colonel
C. de Crespigny issued these orders:</p>

<div class="medium">
<p class="p2">1. In order to have a good “jumping-off” place for
X day it is essential to gain ground forward and dig
a trench running from T.13.b.4.9. to T.14.a.2½.2½.
It will be necessary to establish a post at the top of the
cutting at T.13.b.4.9 and to drive the Germans from
the trench T.13.b.6.4. point of orchard T.14.a.5.5.</p>

<p class="p1">As it was known that the enemy held the point
of the Ginchy orchard, and that they had machine-guns
in the Ginchy&mdash;Flers sunken road, about
four hundred yards north of that village, Captain
G. Harcourt-Vernon, who commanded <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 4
Company, detailed two platoons under Second
Lieutenant T. W. Minchin for the operation,
while <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 2 was to protect their left flank and
keep touch with them. Lieutenant M. H. Macmillan
was ordered to bring up two platoons
from <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 3 Company to support <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 4 Company
and take over the line evacuated by Lieutenant
Minchin’s platoons.</p>

<p>The enterprise was difficult, as the left flank
had to advance farther than the right in order
to form a line facing north-east. By way of
artillery preparation, thirty or forty shrapnel
shells were fired at the German trench just north
of the orchard, but this had the effect only of
putting the enemy on his guard. Unfortunately,
too, it was a bright moonlight night, and the
attacking party showed up distinctly.</p>

<p>The two platoons under Second Lieutenant
Minchin advanced, and cleared the orchard of all
Germans, in spite of a heavy rifle and machine-gun
fire, which caused several casualties. Not
content with this, they tried to push on farther,
but were fiercely resisted by the Germans, and
<!--064.png--><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52"></a><span class="pageno">52</span>
failed to make good any more ground. As it
was imperatively necessary to have a trench
dug before daylight, Second Lieutenant Minchin
decided to hold a line on the edge of the orchard,
and the trench was completed by the next
morning. The task assigned to the party had
been carried out, and there seemed no necessity
to attempt anything further.</p>

<p>That evening the following confidential message
was received:</p>

<p class="blockquote">Day of attack (Z day) will be 15th <abbr title="September">Sept.</abbr> Zero
hours will probably be in the early morning.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><abbr title="September">Sept.</abbr> 14.</p>

<p>All next day the 2nd Battalion remained in
the front trenches, where it was very heavily
shelled. One shell pitched on the headquarters
of <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 1 Company; Company Sergeant-Major
Percival was mortally wounded and died later,
and Captain A. F. R. Wiggins was so severely
shaken that he retired suffering from shell shock.
Company Sergeant-Major Gudgeon of <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 3 Company
was buried by another shell, and had to be
sent back. These losses were particularly regrettable,
just as the Battalion was going into action.</p>

<p>The Battalion was relieved in the evening by
the 2nd and 3rd Battalions Coldstream, and went
into bivouac just behind Ginchy, where rations
and rum were served out. The men had been
three days in the trenches, and <abbr title="Lieutenant">Lieut.</abbr>-Colonel de
Crespigny and the Adjutant, Captain Bailey,
hardly had a moment’s sleep during that time.
It was bitterly cold at night, and the men, who
had no greatcoats, suffered very much.</p>

<p>The time appointed for the attack was revealed
<!--065.png--><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53"></a><span class="pageno">53</span>
during the afternoon, in this message:
“Zero hour to-morrow, September 15, will be
at 6.20 <span class="sc small">A.M.</span>” As shown in the above orders,
four successive objectives had been allotted to
the Brigade. The first was about 1200 yards
distant, and the second 1500&mdash;but this concerned
only the left battalion of the Brigade. The
third was 2500 yards off, while the fourth or
final objective, which included the northern
outskirts of Lesbœufs, was no less than 3500
yards away. The infantry were to advance to
attack the first objective at 6.20 <span class="sc small">A.M.</span>, to the
second at 7.20, the third at 8.20, and the final
objective at 10.50. The front allotted to the
Brigade was 500 yards.</p>

<p>The 2nd and 3rd Battalions Coldstream were
to assault the first, second, and third objectives.
The 2nd Battalion Grenadiers was to follow them,
and form a defensive flank to either side, if
required. On reaching the first objective the
2nd Battalion Grenadiers was to remain there
until the Irish Guards passed through them, and
if the flanks were all secure was to follow on and
support them. The 1st Battalion Irish Guards
was to pass through the 2nd and 3rd Battalions
Coldstream at the third objective, and take and
consolidate the fourth objective.</p>

<p>Each battalion had a section of machine-guns
attached to it, and was told to place two guns
on the flanks of the battalion and two at the
Battalion Headquarters. The 2nd Battalion
Grenadiers had four Stokes guns, while four more
were kept in reserve. Three tanks were to start
on the left outside the Brigade area, and were to

pass into it north of the cutting, which was known
to be a troublesome place, on the left flank.</p>

<p>Detailed instructions for the attack were
issued in the following operation orders by <abbr title="Lieutenant">Lieut.</abbr>-Colonel
C. R. C. de Crespigny, Commanding 2nd
Battalion Grenadier Guards:</p>

and support the Irish Guards in their attack on the

a defensive flank, if necessary, and to support the attack
of the Irish Guards. The Irish Guards will attack the
fourth objective.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><abbr title="September">Sept.</abbr> 15.</p>

<p>At 5 <span class="sc small">A.M.</span> on the 15th the tanks were seen
moving slowly forward on the left flank of the
Brigade, but they apparently aroused no suspicion,
and did not attract any fire. Punctually
at 6.20, the zero hour, the two Coldstream battalions
started off, and immediately came under a
terrific fire from the enemy’s machine-guns. The
unevenness of the “jumping-off line,” and the
total absence of any recognisable landmarks in
that desert of shell-holes, made a certain loss
of direction inevitable. The leaders of the assault
were mown down, but the remainder, undeterred
by losses, pushed on until they were within
twenty yards of the sunken road. It was a red-letter
day in the history of the Coldstream, for
with the 1st Battalion Coldstream from the 2nd
Brigade there were three battalions of Coldstream
all in line.</p>

<p>When they reached the sunken road there was
a momentary check, as the leading companies had
lost a large number of officers or non-commissioned
officers. <abbr title="Lieutenant">Lieut.</abbr>-Colonel J. Campbell saw that to
pause for a moment in the attack would mean
failure, and dashed forward. Knowing that in the
infernal roar of rifle and machine-gun fire no
commands could possibly be heard, he had provided
himself with a hunting-horn, which he
now blew. The familiar sound, piercing the din,
<!--070.png--><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58"></a><span class="pageno">58</span>
instantly arrested the attention of the men, and
they at once followed their Colonel. Straight into
the midst of the enemy they went with an irresistible
rush, and got to work with the bayonet.</p>

<p>Large numbers of Germans were killed or taken
prisoner, and four machine-guns were captured,
in addition to a number of trench mortars.
The casualties in the 2nd Battalion were considerably
increased by the fact that the tank,
which should have passed over the place where
the machine-guns were posted, never reached its
objective, and consequently a gap of 100 yards
was left where it should have gone.</p>

<p>On reaching the road the Coldstream battalions
did not halt, but swept on down the
valley, where they found another entirely unexpected
German line. Their losses had been very
heavy, especially among the officers; in the 2nd
Battalion Coldstream there were only two officers
left besides the Commanding Officer. Yet so
splendid were the rank and file that they “carried
on” as if they still had officers at their head. The
fact that the whole Coldstream Regiment was in
line leading the Guards Division undoubtedly
lent an additional impetus to the whole attack.
When they reached what they thought the
third objective, <abbr title="Lieutenant">Lieut.</abbr>-Colonel Campbell reported
their position to General Feilding, but Lord
Cavan, who had received reports from aeroplanes,
discovered that it was not the third
but the first objective that the Coldstream were
occupying, and sent back at once to say so.</p>

<p>Again the three Coldstream battalions had to
go forward in the face of a withering fire, and
<!--071.png--><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59"></a><span class="pageno">59</span>
were joined soon after they started by <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 2
Company 2nd Battalion Grenadiers under Captain
Cunninghame and parties from the Irish Guards.
But with a heavy barrage from the enemy’s
artillery, in addition to the machine-gun and rifle
fire, an advance was no easy matter. It was
asking a great deal even of a regiment like the
Coldstream to face such a terrible ordeal a second
time, but when they were clear of the German
barrage the note of the hunting-horn once more
rang out and warned them that <abbr title="Lieutenant">Lieut.</abbr>-Colonel
Campbell was in front, calling upon them to
follow. Without hesitation the line again swept
forward, and the second objective was reached.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the 2nd Battalion Grenadiers
started off, moving forward by platoons in
artillery formation some 350 yards in rear of
the Coldstream. With it came <abbr title="Lieutenant">Lieut.</abbr>-Colonel de
Crespigny, who was easily distinguished as he
marched along, for he wore a forage cap in place
of a helmet. When the Battalion reached
Ginchy a heavy German barrage came down on
the men, who were almost blinded by the shells.
Fortunately, the bulk of the barrage was chiefly
on the south side of the village, but huge shells,
bursting at the appalling rate of one a second,
were shooting up showers of mud in every direction,
and the noise was deafening. All this in
addition to a fierce rifle fire, which came from the
right rear. Though the softness of the ground
prevented many shells from exploding, there were
naturally a considerable number of casualties.
Captain M. K. A. Lloyd was killed as he came
along with his half company through the barrage,
<!--072.png--><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60"></a><span class="pageno">60</span>
and Lieutenant Macmillan was slightly wounded
in the knee, but was able to go on. Lieutenant
Hasler, who was severely wounded in the stomach,
never recovered from his wound, and about the
same time Second Lieutenant J. Arbuthnott was
also fatally wounded.</p>

<p>Twenty minutes later <abbr title="Lieutenant">Lieut.</abbr>-Colonel de Crespigny
decided to push on, and the Battalion
emerged from the barrage with its right on the
Ginchy&mdash;Lesbœufs road, but nothing could be
seen of the two Coldstream battalions. It turned
out afterwards that the leading battalions of the
2nd Guards Brigade, which were on the right, had
started off in the wrong direction, and had consequently
pushed the Coldstream battalions in the
1st Guards Brigade too far to the left, so that they
were no longer in front of their support. The
orders given to the Grenadiers were to keep their
right on the Ginchy&mdash;Lesbœufs road, and this
they had managed to do in spite of the barrage.
<abbr title="Lieutenant">Lieut.</abbr>-Colonel de Crespigny knew he was in his
right place, but was totally unable to understand
what had happened to the Coldstream battalions.</p>

<p>He sent a message to General Pereira and
received the following reply:</p>

<p class="blockquote">Your pigeon message timed 7.45 <span class="sc small">A.M.</span> not quite clear.
Irish Guards reported their Headquarters in Green
line (first objective) and in touch with 41st Brigade
on left at 8.45 <span class="sc small">A.M.</span> You state no signs of Coldstream.
Presume they are pushing on to next objective. Am
sending bombs up.</p>

<p>Throughout the day it appears to have been
assumed that the 2nd Battalion Grenadiers was
in touch with the two Coldstream battalions, but
<!--073.png--><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61"></a><span class="pageno">61</span>
although the Coldstream were fully aware of the
position of the Grenadiers, the Grenadiers had no
knowledge of the whereabouts of the Coldstream.</p>

<p>Almost immediately after the 2nd Battalion
Grenadiers cleared the barrage it came under
machine-gun fire from the left front and rifle fire
from the right rear. Instead of finding itself, as
it expected, in rear of the Coldstream, it was
suddenly confronted by a trench full of the
enemy. This was the first objective, which the
men naturally imagined had been taken by the
Coldstream. Here they were in artillery formation
instead of in line, marching forward under the
impression that the two battalions of Coldstream
were in front of them. To approach the trench
with any prospect of success it was necessary to
deploy into line, and in doing this they lost very
heavily. Our creeping barrage had, so to speak,
run away, and there was now no artillery support
of any kind.</p>

<p>The companies on the right pushed on into
the Green line, the first objective, and there
gained touch with the 3rd Battalion Grenadiers
in Ponsonby’s Brigade, which was attempting to
stop the Germans turning its right flank. Here
Lieutenant Jesper was wounded, and Lieutenant
Macmillan, who had gone on in spite of the wound
in his knee, was struck a second time in the left
thigh. The attack of the Division on the right
had failed, with the result that the right flank
of the Guards Division was dangerously in the air.
On the left there was a considerable gap, which
caused great trouble, as it happened to be opposite
one of the enemy’s strong points. Lieutenant
<!--074.png--><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62"></a><span class="pageno">62</span>
A. T. A. Ritchie was wounded as he was trying to
deal with this difficult situation, and Sergeant
Lyon, who took charge of his platoon, was soon
afterwards shot through the head.</p>

<p>One platoon of <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 1 Company with a machine-gun
went out and succeeded in forming a defensive
flank, thus preventing the Germans, who
were in considerable strength, from working
behind us. The greater part of the casualties
in the 2nd Battalion occurred about this time.
Although three of our machine-guns reached the
first objective, two were instantly required on the
right flank, as the Sixth Division had failed to take
the Quadrilateral; this left only one to deal with
the Germans on the left. The centre of the Battalion
then rushed a part of the Green line and
bayoneted all the Germans who did not surrender,
making prisoners of the rest. One German soldier
who was taken in this way thought it too dangerous
to wait for an escort and ran off towards our
supports, holding up his hands as he went.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the left of the Battalion was still
held up outside the wire of the first objective, as
the two Coldstream battalions had apparently
passed still farther to the left. As soon as the
companies in the centre entered the trench which
was the first objective, the enemy started bombing
down it from the left. The Grenadier bombers
ran short of bombs and were powerless to stop
the rush. The situation looked ugly, when Company
Sergeant-Major J. Norton, who was lying
outside the wire, gathered some men together and
led a bayonet attack against the German bombers.
This momentarily relieved the situation.</p>

<p><!--075.png--><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63"></a><span class="pageno">63</span>
All available bombs were then collected, and a
party began to work up the trench, but on reaching
the enemy they were driven back with great
loss. The situation again became critical, as the
Germans were slowly driving our men back.
Captain Harcourt-Vernon, finding that the supply
of bombs had given out, determined not to waste
any more men’s lives in what must necessarily
be a one-sided contest, and organised a bayonet
charge over the top.</p>

<p>Calling on the Adjutant, Captain Bailey, to
come with him, he led the charge and took the
German bombers completely by surprise. Many
of them were killed before they realised what had
happened, and forty to fifty more in rear all surrendered.
Captain Harcourt-Vernon himself, on
arrival at the enemy’s trench, was confronted by
a stalwart German who immediately held up both
hands and was made a prisoner, but Captain
Bailey’s man proved a fighter although, happily,
a bad shot. Captain Bailey missed him with the
first three shots of his automatic pistol, but
despatched him with the fourth.</p>

<p>The Grenadier bombers, having managed to
find some more bombs, now worked along the
trench to the left, and the Germans who had
escaped from Captain Harcourt-Vernon’s bayonet
attack broke and ran across the open to their
support trench. Having cleared the line for some
distance, the Grenadiers began to consolidate.
Two small parties of the enemy tried to return
but were dealt with by Lewis guns. Lieutenant
Crookshank, who was in charge of these guns, was
wounded by a <abbr title="high explosive">H.E.</abbr> shell which exploded a few
<!--076.png--><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64"></a><span class="pageno">64</span>
yards in front of him, and Captain Lord Lascelles,
who was explaining to Captain Beaumont-Nesbitt
what he wanted him to do, and had just sent for
a runner, was hit by a bullet and had his arm
broken.</p>

<p>Meanwhile <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 2 Company under Captain
Cunninghame had pushed forward, and got into
line with the 3rd Coldstream, some 500 yards to
the left front of the remainder of the Grenadiers,
who were in the first objective, with the 3rd
Grenadiers on their right and a mixture of men
from the Guards Division on their left. The
Irish Guards had followed the Coldstream, and
had been able to send up some platoons to support
them.</p>

<p>When the aeroplanes reported that the two
Coldstream battalions were not at the third but
between the first and second objectives, General
Feilding despatched the 2nd Battalion Scots
Guards from the 3rd Brigade, which was in
reserve, to support them. But their position
was not accurately known, and only one company
with two Lewis guns reached them.</p>

<p>During the afternoon Lord Cavan had issued
orders for the third objective to be bombarded
by heavy artillery. On hearing this, General
Pereira strongly protested, as he believed that
two of his battalions were already occupying
that position. But Lord Cavan was so well
satisfied that the aeroplane reports were correct
that he overruled the protests, and the bombardment
took place.</p>

<p>Further and costly attempts to retake the lost
ground were made by the enemy during the
<!--077.png--><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65"></a><span class="pageno">65</span>
evening, but all their counter-attacks were easily
repulsed. The position in the evening was this:
the remnants of the 2nd and 3rd Battalions
Coldstream and the Irish Guards, with one company
of the 2nd Battalion Grenadiers and one
company of the 2nd Battalion Scots Guards, were
holding the second objective. The 2nd Battalion
Grenadiers was holding the first objective
to the right, with its right flank on the Ginchy&mdash;Lesbœufs
road and in touch with the 3rd
Battalion Grenadiers.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><abbr title="September">Sept.</abbr> 16.</p>

<p>Nothing of importance happened during the
night of the 15th, and the 1st Guards Brigade
remained in the same position throughout the
16th, when it was subjected to a terrific shelling.
That evening the troops in the first objective were
relieved by the 59th Brigade, and those in the
second objective by the 62nd Brigade. The 2nd
Battalion Grenadiers was relieved by the 15th
King’s Royal Rifles and retired about five miles
to bivouacs, where it arrived dead-beat, having
had practically no sleep for five days. It slept
through the whole day on the 17th.</p>

<p>The casualties throughout the 13th, 14th, and
15th were: killed and died of wounds 108, 235
wounded, and 12 missing&mdash;total 365, excluding
officers. Amongst the officers, Captain M. K. A.
Lloyd was killed, and Lieutenant H. Hasler and
Second Lieutenant J. Arbuthnott were seriously
wounded and died a few days later, while the
following were wounded: Captain Lord Lascelles,
Lieutenant T. Parker Jervis, Lieutenant M. H.
Macmillan, Lieutenant A. T. A. Ritchie, Lieutenant
H. F. C. Crookshank, Second Lieutenant
<!--078.png--><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66"></a><span class="pageno">66</span>
T. W. Minchin, Second Lieutenant N. McK.
Jesper, Second Lieutenant D. Harvey, and
Second Lieutenant C. C. Cubitt.</p>

<p>Captain J. Andrews, <abbr title="Royal Army Medical Corps">R.A.M.C.</abbr>, was also
wounded, but insisted on remaining at duty.
His gallant conduct throughout these three days
elicited much praise from the Commanding
Officer.</p>

<p>General Pereira addressed the following
message to the 2nd Battalion:</p>

<p>As your Brigadier I wish to say in a few words how
deeply I appreciate the gallant work done by you in
the recent operations at Ginchy.</p>

<p>On the 12th September you took over Ginchy trenches,
and the following night you drove the German out of
Ginchy Orchard; this work caused you one hundred
casualties, but by your fine work you cleared the ground
for the advance on September 15, and ensured that it
would not be held up at the very beginning.</p>

<p>On September 15 your first advance was through
a heavy artillery barrage, but owing to the splendid
discipline of your Regiment, you went through it as if
on parade.</p>

<p>Your opportunity came later on when you cleared
trenches at the point of the bayonet, having run out of
bombs, and when you charged a trench strongly held
and in the face of machine-gun fire.</p>

<p>You have shown the Germans what they have to
expect when they meet the pick of the British Army.</p>

<p>In the near future you may be called upon to do as
much again, and I know that you will not fail.</p>

17-20.</p>

<p>The 2nd Battalion remained at the Citadel
from September 17 to 20 with the rest of Pereira’s
Brigade. The weather was wet and cold, and
the Brigade was busily employed in absorbing
drafts. On the 19th a conference of Commanding
Officers was held at Brigade Headquarters,
when the frontage and objectives for the attack
which was to take place on the 25th were outlined.
As the front allotted to the Brigade was
700 yards, it was decided to attack with three
battalions in front and one in support; but when
this scheme was subsequently changed, and the
frontage decreased to 500 yards, it was proposed
to entrust the next attack to the 2nd Battalion
Grenadiers and 1st Battalion Irish Guards, with
the 2nd and 3rd Battalions Coldstream in support.</p>

<p>On the 20th the Brigade began moving in
companies from the Citadel to relieve the 61st
Brigade. It was still very wet, and the roads
were blocked by transport in a sea of mud. The
weather had now broken, and owing to the cold
nights the men took their greatcoats with them,
though the rest of their spare equipment was
stored as before.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><abbr title="September">Sept.</abbr>
20-24.</p>

<p>The two Coldstream battalions remained in
the front line from the 20th to the 24th, while the
2nd Battalion Grenadiers and 1st Battalion Irish
Guards, who were to undertake the attack, were
bivouacked in Bernafay and Trônes Woods. The
3rd Guards Brigade was employed in digging an
assembly trench about 150 yards in rear of our
front line. The fact that the trench was completed
only the night before the attack accounted
for the Germans being, apparently, ignorant of
<!--080.png--><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68"></a><span class="pageno">68</span>
its exact situation, for although they shelled all
the other trenches this one escaped their notice.
The 2nd Battalion Grenadiers was put on to
salvage work and carrying during the days that
preceded the attack.</p>

<p>On the 21st the following orders were issued
by Brigadier-General Pereira:</p>

<p>There will be no intensive fire previous to zero hour.</p>

<p><i>Forming-up Areas</i>&mdash;</p>

<p>5. Forming-up areas, boundaries, and objectives are
shown on the attached map.</p>

<p><!--081.png--><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69"></a><span class="pageno">69</span></p>

<p class="p0 indent2">The first objective is marked Green.</p>
<p class="p0 indent2">The second objective is marked Brown.</p>
<p class="p0 indent2">The third objective is marked Blue.</p>

<p><i>Formation for Attack</i>&mdash;</p>

<p>6. The 2nd <abbr title="Battalion">Bn.</abbr> Grenadier Guards and 1st <abbr title="Battalion">Bn.</abbr> Irish
Guards will form up in two lines&mdash;one in the firing line
and one in the support line.</p>

<p>The 2nd <abbr title="Battalion">Bn.</abbr> Coldstream Guards will form up in the
communication trench from T.8.a.9.4 to T.3.c.3.8.</p>

<p>The 3rd <abbr title="Battalion">Bn.</abbr> Coldstream Guards will form up in the
trench from T.8.a.9.4 to T.8.d.5.5.</p>

<p>The 1st Guards Brigade Machine-gun <abbr title="Company">Coy.</abbr> will
assemble with one section at the head of 2nd <abbr title="Battalion">Bn.</abbr> Coldstream
Guards&mdash;one section in rear of 2nd <abbr title="Battalion">Bn.</abbr> Coldstream
Guards and one section on right of 3rd <abbr title="Battalion">Bn.</abbr> Coldstream
Guards.</p>

<p>The 1st Guards Brigade Trench Mortar Battery will
form up with two guns on right of front line and two
guns on right of support line.</p>

<p>The 75th Field <abbr title="Royal Engineers">R.E.</abbr> and work platoons will form up
in trenches T.8.d.</p>

<p>7. The infantry will advance to the attack of the
Green line at zero&mdash;to the attack of the Brown line at
zero + 1 hour. To the attack of the Blue line at zero
+ 2 hours.</p>

<p><i>Barrages</i>&mdash;</p>

<p>8. (<i>a</i>) 50 per cent of Field Artillery barrage will be
used for creeping barrage, and 50 per cent for stationary
barrage.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) In all cases the stationary barrage will lift back
when the creeping barrage meets it.</p>

<p>9. (<i>a</i>) At zero the creeping barrage will start 100
yards in front of our front-line trenches. It will advance
at the rate of 50 yards a minute until it is 200 yards
beyond the Green line, when it will become stationary.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) At zero + 1 hour, the creeping barrage will start
200 yards in front of the Green line, and will advance
at the rate of 50 yards a minute until it has passed
<!--082.png--><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70"></a><span class="pageno">70</span>
200 yards beyond the Brown line, when it will become
stationary.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) At zero + 2 hours the creeping barrage will start
100 yards in front of the Brown line, and will advance
at the rate of 50 yards a minute until it has passed
100 yards beyond the Blue line, when it will become
stationary.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) Other permanent barrages are being arranged
along certain sunken roads.</p>

<p><i>Tasks</i>&mdash;</p>

<p>10. (<i>a</i>) The task of the Division is to press the attack
through to the Blue line. A sufficient flow of troops
will be maintained from zero onwards to ensure that the
Brown line is strong and well supported.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) The attack on all objectives will be carried out
by 2nd <abbr title="Battalion">Bn.</abbr> Grenadier Guards on the right and 1st <abbr title="Battalion">Bn.</abbr>
Irish Guards on the left.</p>

<p>The 2nd and 3rd Bns. Coldstream Guards will be
in support under command of <abbr title="Lieutenant">Lieut.</abbr>-Colonel J. V.
Campbell, <abbr title="Distinguished Service Order">D.S.O.</abbr></p>

<p><i>Method of Assault</i>&mdash;</p>

<p>11. The assault will be carried out by leading
battalions in two waves of 75 yards’ distance.</p>

<p><i>Action of Support Battalions</i>&mdash;</p>

<p>12. As soon as the front and support lines are vacated
by 2nd <abbr title="Battalion">Bn.</abbr> Grenadier Guards and 1st <abbr title="Battalion">Bn.</abbr> Irish Guards
the 2nd <abbr title="Battalion">Bn.</abbr> Coldstream Guards and 3rd <abbr title="Battalion">Bn.</abbr> Coldstream
Guards will occupy them.</p>

<p>All movement to these lines by supporting units
should be by the communication trench from T.8.a.9.4
to T.8.c.3.8.</p>

<p>Similarly 2nd and 3rd Bns. Coldstream Guards will
occupy the Green and Brown lines as soon as they are
vacated by 2nd <abbr title="Battalion">Bn.</abbr> Grenadier Guards and 1st <abbr title="Battalion">Bn.</abbr> Irish
Guards.</p>

<p>As soon as the 2nd <abbr title="Battalion">Bn.</abbr> Grenadier Guards and 1st
<abbr title="Battalion">Bn.</abbr> Irish Guards have gained the Brown line, 2nd and
<!--083.png--><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71"></a><span class="pageno">71</span>
3rd Bns. Coldstream Guards will each send a company
as clearing-up parties in Lesbœufs. These two companies
must shelter in shell-holes behind the Brown line
during the pause on that line. They must on no account
be mixed up with 2nd <abbr title="Battalion">Bn.</abbr> Grenadier Guards and 1st
<abbr title="Battalion">Bn.</abbr> Irish Guards. They will carry a special supply
of P. bombs and Mills grenades for dealing with cellars.</p>

<p>The 2nd and 3rd Bns. Coldstream Guards are responsible
for making good each objective as captured,
and for guarding either flank if threatened, paying
special attention to the right flank.</p>

<p><abbr title="Lieutenant">Lieut.</abbr>-Colonel J. V. Campbell, <abbr title="Distinguished Service Order">D.S.O.</abbr>, commanding
supporting battalions, will be prepared to give such
additional support as may be required to carry out the
attack on the final objective&mdash;bearing in mind the
necessity for holding positions already captured.</p>

<p><i>Machine-guns</i>&mdash;</p>

<p>13. (<i>a</i>) At the first favourable opportunity after the
Green line has been captured, <abbr title="Officer Commanding">O.C.</abbr> Machine-gun <abbr title="Company">Coy.</abbr>
will send one section forward to it. In this line and in
his subsequent move to the Brown line two guns will
always be on the right flank, ready to assist in the
formation of a defensive flank.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Similarly, when the Brown and Blue lines have
been captured, one section will be sent forward to help
in the consolidation of each of these lines.</p>

<p>Thus when the final objective has been captured
there should be four guns in the Blue line and eight in
reserve in the Brown line.</p>

<p><i>Stokes <abbr title="Trench Mortar">T.M.</abbr> </i>&mdash;</p>

<p>14. (<i>a</i>) Previous to the assault two guns will be
established on the right of the Brigade area. These
two guns will move forward at the first favourable
opportunity and establish themselves on the right of
the Green line.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Two other guns will be in reserve in the front line,
and will only move forward to the Green line if ordered
<!--084.png--><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72"></a><span class="pageno">72</span>
to do so by <abbr title="Lieutenant">Lieut.</abbr>-Colonel J. V. Campbell, <abbr title="Distinguished Service Order">D.S.O.</abbr>, or
by the Brigadier.</p>

<p><i><abbr title="Royal Engineers">R.E.</abbr> and Work Platoons</i>&mdash;</p>

<p>15. 75th Field <abbr title="Company">Coy.</abbr> <abbr title="Royal Engineers">R.E.</abbr> and Work Platoons will
move forward from their assembly area to the trench
about T.8.b.3.0, as soon as this trench is clear of 3rd
<abbr title="Battalion">Bn.</abbr> Coldstream Guards. They will be ready to move
forward on receipt of orders from Brigade <abbr title="Headquarters">H.Q.</abbr> and
consolidate ground gained. <abbr title="Officer Commanding">O.C.</abbr> 75th Field <abbr title="Company">Coy.</abbr> <abbr title="Royal Engineers">R.E.</abbr>
will detail one officer and three orderlies in liaison with
<abbr title="Officer Commanding">O.C.</abbr> supporting battalions.</p>

<p><i>Patrols</i>&mdash;</p>

<p>16. When the Blue line has been gained, patrols will
be sent forward, and any ground from which good
observation can be gained will be occupied.</p>

<p>Such points will be consolidated and eventually
joined up with our line.</p>

<p><i>Contact Patrol and Flares</i>&mdash;</p>

<p>17. One contact aeroplane will be in the air from
zero till 6.30 <span class="sc small">P.M.</span> on Z day. Flares will be lit by leading
infantry lines on obtaining each objective and also at
6 <i>P.M.</i> on Z day.</p>

<p>18. Watches will be synchronised at 7 <span class="sc small">P.M.</span> on Y day
and at 9 <span class="sc small">A.M.</span> on Z day.</p>

<p><i>First Line Transport</i>&mdash;</p>

<p>19. Ammunition portions of first line Transport will
be collected on the south-west side of Bernafay Wood
to the south of the Guillemont&mdash;Montauban Road, and
remainder of first line Transport in the neighbourhood
of Minden Post by 12 noon on Z day.</p>

<p>Brigade Transport Officer will detail an orderly to
be in waiting at Advanced Divisional <abbr title="Headquarters">H.Q.</abbr> Bernafay
Wood, and will himself be at Minden Post from 12 noon
on Z day to receive instructions.</p>

<p><i>Prisoners</i>&mdash;</p>

<p>20. Prisoners will be sent back to the Corps Cage at
the Craters A.8.a under escort. In future correspondence
<!--085.png--><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73"></a><span class="pageno">73</span>
will not be taken off prisoners except off officers. Officers’
documents will be removed as soon as they are captured
and sent to the Corps Cage with their escort.</p>

<p><i>Dumps</i>&mdash;</p>

<p>21. An advanced Brigade Dump of bombs&mdash;<abbr title="Small Arms Ammunition">S.A.A.</abbr>&mdash;Stokes
mortar ammunition&mdash;<abbr title="Royal Engineers">R.E.</abbr> material and rations
has been established about T.8.c central.</p>

<p><i>Equipment</i>&mdash;</p>

<p>22. The equipment to be carried by assaulting troops
will be the same as that laid down for the attack on
September 15.</p>

<p>23. Arrangements have been made for the Brigade
on our right to open enfilade machine-gun and trench-mortar
fire on the Green line from about T.9.d.3.9 at
zero. This fire will be continued until the creeping
barrage passes beyond the Green line.</p>

<p><i>Medical Arrangements</i>&mdash;</p>

<p>24. Medical arrangements will be notified later.</p>

<p><i>Brigade Headquarters</i>&mdash;</p>

<p>25. Brigade Headquarters will be at T.19.a.½.3½.
An advanced Brigade Report Centre will be established
in the communication trench T.8.b&mdash;T.3.c on
September 22.</p>

<p>Pigeons will be supplied to the battalions on Z day
as follows:</p>

<p class="indent2">3 to 2nd <abbr title="Battalion">Bn.</abbr> Grenadier Guards.</p>
<p class="p0 indent2">3 to 1st <abbr title="Battalion">Bn.</abbr> Irish Guards.</p>
<p class="p0 indent2">6 to 3rd <abbr title="Battalion">Bn.</abbr> Coldstream Guards.</p>

<p>As soon as all pigeons have been released pigeon men
must return at once to Brigade Headquarters.</p>

<p>26. Z day will be September 23. Zero hour will be
notified later. It will probably be in the afternoon.</p>

A Memorandum from the Brigade-Major on
the lie of the land followed.</p>

<div class="medium">
<p class="p1 center"><span class="sc">1st Guards Brigade, <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 262</span></p>

<p class="unindent"><span class="sc">2nd <abbr title="Battalion">Batt.</abbr> Grenadier Guards</span>&mdash;</p>

<p>The forthcoming attack differs from the last in that
the whole scheme is not such an ambitious one. The
distance to the first objective is about 300 yards, to
the second objective 800 yards, and to the last objective
about 1300 yards. In each case the objective is a
clearly defined one, and not merely a line drawn across
the map.</p>

<p>Between our present front line and the first objective
there is only “No Man’s Land.” During the next two
nights this should be actively patrolled to ensure that
our attack is not taken by surprise by some unknown
trench, and in order that Officers and <abbr title="Non Commissioned Officer">N.C.O.</abbr>’s may have
a knowledge of the ground.</p>

<p>It would also be of great assistance to the Artillery
if reports as to the actual distance to the Green line
were sent in.</p>

<p>The ground slopes down to Lesbœufs, beyond which
there is a distinct hollow with a plateau the same level
as Lesbœufs beyond. On reaching the final objective
Officers and <abbr title="Non Commissioned Officer">N.C.O.</abbr>’s should understand the necessity
for pushing patrols out to command this hollow and
give warning or prevent counter-attacks forming up
here.</p>

<p>Large-scale maps of Lesbœufs have been sent to
all battalions. These should be carefully studied by
all Officers and <abbr title="Non Commissioned Officer">N.C.O.</abbr>’s, and especially by those of the
companies detailed for the cleaning up of Lesbœufs.</p>

<p>All runners and signallers should know the position
of the advanced Brigade Report Centre, and that the
best means of approach to it will probably be down the
communication trench T.3.c and T.8.b.</p>

<p>Finally, it cannot be too much impressed on assaulting
troops the necessity for clinging to our own barrage.
<!--087.png--><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75"></a><span class="pageno">75</span>
It will be an attack in which this should be comparatively
easy and on which the success of the whole
operation may depend.</p>

line, a sufficient flow of troops being maintained to
ensure that the Brown line is strong and well supported.</p>

<p>6. (<i>a</i>) At zero the creeping barrage will start 100
yards in front of our front-line trenches. It will advance
at the rate of 50 yards a minute until it is 200 yards
beyond the Green line, when it will become stationary.</p>

<p>At zero <abbr title="Numbers">Nos.</abbr> 1 and 2 <abbr title="Companies">Coys.</abbr> will advance to the attack
of the Green line, followed at 75 yards’ distance by
<abbr title="Numbers">Nos.</abbr> 3 and 4 <abbr title="Companies">Coys.</abbr>, who will not stop at our old front
line but will push on into the Green line. On reaching
the Green line companies will at once reorganise.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) At zero + 1 hour the creeping barrage will start
200 yards in front of the Green line, and will advance
at the rate of 50 yards a minute until it is 200 yards
beyond the Brown line, when it will become stationary.
At zero + 1 hour <abbr title="Numbers">Nos.</abbr> 3 and 4 <abbr title="Companies">Coys.</abbr> will advance to the
attack of the Brown line, followed by <abbr title="Numbers">Nos.</abbr> 1 and 2 <abbr title="Companies">Coys.</abbr>

<p>At zero + 2 hours <abbr title="Numbers">Nos.</abbr> 1 and 2 <abbr title="Companies">Coys.</abbr> will attack the
Blue line, followed by <abbr title="Numbers">Nos.</abbr> 3 and 4 <abbr title="Companies">Coys.</abbr> at 75 yards’
distance. The Battalion will consolidate on the Blue
line and hold it at all costs.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) Other permanent barrages are being arranged
along certain sunken roads.</p>

<p>When the Blue line has been gained, patrols will be
pushed forward at once to seize and hold any point from
which good observation can be obtained.</p>

<p>7. <i>Lewis Guns.</i>&mdash;Each company will have one Lewis
gun: the remainder (four) under <abbr title="Lieutenant">Lieut.</abbr> Knatchbull-Hugessen
will move up with the second wave and be
prepared to act against hostile machine-guns in the
village or forward objectives or against counter-attacks.
<!--089.png--><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77"></a><span class="pageno">77</span>
They will also be ready to form a defensive flank to the
right or left.</p>

<p>8. <i>Mopping Up.</i>&mdash;The dug-outs in the first and second
objectives will be promptly dealt with by <abbr title="Numbers">Nos.</abbr> 3 and 4
<abbr title="Companies">Coys.</abbr> As soon as the Battalion has gained the Brown
line, the 2nd and 3rd <abbr title="Battalions">Batts.</abbr> Coldstream will occupy the
Green line, and will each send clearing parties of 1 <abbr title="Company">Coy.</abbr>
to clear the village of Lesbœufs.</p>

<p>9. <i>Dress and Equipment.</i>&mdash;Greatcoats will not be
carried, and arrangements will be made for them to be
collected before moving up.</p>

<p>Following will be carried: Per man&mdash;three sand-bags,
two bandoliers, two Mills bombs, one day’s rations, one
iron ration. A large percentage of each company will
carry slung shovels. Flares will be carried by every
officer and platoon sergeant, and the remainder of the
flares and rockets will be distributed among the

Late on the night of the 24th the Brigade was
informed that zero hour would be 12.35 <span class="sc small">P.M.</span> the
next day. The 2nd Battalion Grenadiers moved
up that night from Bernafay Wood to relieve the
2nd Battalion Coldstream in the trenches preparatory
to the attack, with its right on the
Ginchy&mdash;Lesbœufs road. On arrival at the
assembly trench <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 1 Company was placed on
the right and <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 2 on the left, with <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 3 and
<abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 4 in support. The trenches were so narrow
that the men were unable to sit or lie down, and
had to remain standing all the next morning,
shoulder to shoulder.</p>

<p>Punctually at 12.35 <span class="sc small">P.M.</span> the attack was
launched, and immediately the creeping barrage
was put down by our artillery with great accuracy
200 yards in front of the attacking force. The
necessity of getting men across No Man’s Land
as promptly as possible after zero had been found
from experience to be of paramount importance,
and the Grenadier and Irish Guards therefore did
not hesitate for a moment, but dashed forward
in two waves. The enemy must have had some
very accurate information about our intentions,
for the attackers had hardly left their trench (it
was three-quarters of a minute after zero) when
they put down a heavy barrage on our front
trenches, as well as on the support and communication
trenches.</p>

<p>The leading wave of men was able to get close
up under our creeping barrage, and the Irish
Guards found no difficulty in capturing the first
objective at the point of the bayonet. The 2nd
Battalion Grenadiers would have had an equally
<!--092.png--><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80"></a><span class="pageno">80</span>
simple task but for the fact that the wire in front
of them, which was in standing crops and therefore
hidden, had been very little damaged by our
artillery fire. There seemed no possibility of
getting through it, with the Germans so close,
and for the moment the whole advance of the
Grenadiers was held up.</p>

<p>Captain A. Cunninghame, Second Lieutenant
G. A. Arbuthnot, Lieutenant W. Parnell, and
Lieutenant Irvine at once ordered their men to lie
down, and the four gallantly advancing by themselves
proceeded with the utmost coolness to cut
gaps in the wire. Their one thought seems to
have been that the attack must not be checked
on any account, and as the task of cutting the
wire meant almost certain death, they never
thought of sending on any of their men, but
decided to do it themselves. Captain Cunninghame,
Second Lieutenant G. Arbuthnot, and
Lieutenant Parnell were killed, and Lieutenant
Irvine was wounded, but sufficient room was made
for the men to go through, and the Grenadiers
swept forward into the first objective.</p>

<p>Apparently the line was strongly held by the
enemy, and a large number were killed and one
man taken prisoner, while three machine-guns fell
into our hands. Lieutenant H. Wiggins, who was
on the extreme right, was trying to creep down
the fire-swept sunken road when he was struck
by a fragment of a shell which burst near him.
Lieutenant Knatchbull-Hugessen brought up the
Lewis guns by the sunken road and did great
execution with them. He was still directing the
fire of his guns, although wounded and covered
<!--095.png--><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81"></a><span class="pageno">81</span>
with blood, when a shell pitched on the road near
him and killed him.</p>

<!--094.png--><!--Blank Page-->

<p>By 1.30 the first objective was entirely in our
hands, and five minutes later the advance to
the second objective began, close up under our
barrage. This was a complete success, as the
barrage kept the enemy in their trenches, and
they had not even shown themselves when the
Grenadiers and Irish Guards were on them with
the bayonet.</p>

<p>After the capture of the first objective there
were only two company officers left, Lieutenant A.
Lawson-Johnston and Second Lieutenant Layland-Barratt,
and the attack on the second objective
was practically carried out by the non-commissioned
officers. Never have the sergeants of
the regiment showed to better advantage. The
skill with which they handled their companies or
platoons, their quick grasp of an order conveyed
to them, and the intelligent way in which they
carried out their instructions elicited the warmest
praise from the Commanding Officer.</p>

<p>By 1.45 <span class="sc small">P.M.</span> the second objective was secured,
and many of the enemy killed. The dug-outs in
the sunken road on the right of the Grenadiers
were all searched, and a large number of prisoners
taken. The following message was received from
Brigade Headquarters:</p>

<p class="blockquote">Prisoner you sent down states that the rest of his
Company are in dug-outs or subterranean passages
about 250 yards east of Lesbœufs and south of the
sunken road. He appears to think they are anxious
to surrender, but gives no reasons. In thinking this
he seems to be more talkative than reliable.</p>

<p class="unindent"><!--096.png--><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82"></a><span class="pageno">82</span>
The prisoner proved to be right, though, by the
time the search of these dug-outs started, all their
occupants had already run out, holding up their
hands. During this second phase of the attack,
the enemy appear to have offered little resistance,
and many more were captured than killed.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the company of Coldstream under
Captain Verelst which had been detailed for
clearing Lesbœufs closed up in rear of the
Grenadiers, according to the programme, and at
2.35 <span class="sc small">P.M.</span> the advance on the third objective
began. To this also there was little resistance,
and soon the Grenadiers and Irish Guards were
established in a line 100 yards east of Lesbœufs
village. During the whole of their advance the
Grenadiers had kept in perfect touch with the
Irish Guards on their left and the 1st West Yorks
on their right, and the orders were carried out
almost to the minute. However, the situation on
the left of the 1st Guards Brigade seemed doubtful,
and General Pereira therefore sent up a
company from the 3rd Battalion Coldstream to
strengthen that flank.</p>

<p>Thus Lesbœufs passed into our hands, and
these positions, which had been considered quite
impregnable, were taken by the combination of
the creeping barrage and a simultaneous infantry
attack.</p>

<p>It was about this time that the only real
hitch in the attack occurred. Arrangements
had been made for the artillery barrage to be
put down 200 yards east of the final objective,
but the position of the trench was marked
differently on the artillery and infantry maps,
<!--097.png--><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83"></a><span class="pageno">83</span>
and the shells fell short. This not only caused
a good many casualties amongst the men who
were digging in, but also prevented the attacking
force from pushing forward patrols and occupying
the best ground for observation. A furious
message was sent back by Captain Bailey: ”Our
artillery are blowing us out. Please stop it at
once,” but whether the messages miscarried or
whether the maps were so inaccurate that the
orders were not understood, the shelling continued
for nearly two hours.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the 2nd and 3rd Battalions Coldstream
moved up by the new communication
trench to the support line and thence across the
open to the first objective, where they remained
in support.</p>

<p>When the barrage eventually cleared away it
was found that there were practically no Germans
in front, although a good many of them could be
seen running towards Le Transloy without rifles
or equipment, and the enemy were not shelling
us at all, no doubt because they had been obliged
to move their guns. It seemed to <abbr title="Lieutenant">Lieut.</abbr>-Colonel
de Crespigny that some advantage should be
taken of this situation, and he sent a message
back that it was a splendid opportunity for
the cavalry to go through. Lord Cavan, however,
decided that the circumstances did not
permit of such a move, as the front was too
narrow.</p>

<p>Lord Cavan sent the following message to
General Pereira:</p>

<p class="blockquote">Hearty thanks and sincere congratulations to you
all. A very fine achievement, splendidly executed.</p>

<p class="unindent"><!--098.png--><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84"></a><span class="pageno">84</span>
To which General Pereira replied:</p>

<p class="blockquote">Your old Brigade very proud to be able to present
you with Lesbœufs. All ranks most gratified by your
kind congratulations.</p>

<p class="unindent">Later this message was received from General
Ponsonby, commanding the 2nd Guards Brigade:</p>

<p class="blockquote"><abbr title="General Officer Commanding">G.O.C.</abbr> and all ranks wish to congratulate the 1st and
3rd Guards Brigades on their splendid success to-day.</p>

<p>The men were in the highest spirits, and that
evening they had a quiet time even in the front
trench, so quiet that there was no difficulty in
getting supplies up. During the night each
battalion was ordered to thin out the front line,
as there were far too many men in the trench;
this order was carried out, but next morning it
was found that still further thinning had to be
done.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><abbr title="September">Sept.</abbr> 26.</p>

<p>On the 26th the 2nd Battalion Grenadiers and
Irish Guards received orders to try and push
patrols on to the ridge which ran 800 yards east
of Lesbœufs; but, although this might have been
possible the night before, it was found to be impracticable
now as the Germans had had time to
recover, and had established a strong line of posts
with machine-guns, so that our patrols were unable
to advance more than 300 yards.</p>

<p>That night the 2nd Battalion Grenadiers was
relieved by the 2nd Battalion Irish Guards from
the 2nd Guards Brigade, and marched back to the
Citadel Camp, where it arrived at 4 <span class="sc small">A.M.</span> on the
27th, after stopping on the way at the south end
of Bernafay Wood for hot food provided by the
cookers.</p>

<p><!--099.png--><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85"></a><span class="pageno">85</span>
The casualties in the Battalion were 108 killed,
222 wounded, and 12 missing, making a total of
312 excluding officers. Considering what had
been accomplished this was surprisingly little, but
the percentage of officers was very high, the
result, no doubt, of the fact that the wire had not
been cut at the first objective. Captain A. K. S.
Cunninghame, Lieutenant the <abbr title="Honorable">Hon.</abbr> W. A. D.
Parnell, Lieutenant M. A. Knatchbull-Hugessen,
and Lieutenant G. A. Arbuthnot were killed, and
Captain Harcourt-Vernon, Captain Beaumont-Nesbitt,
Lieutenant A. F. Irvine, Lieutenant
H. G. Wiggins, and Lieutenant R. B. B. Wright
were wounded.</p>

<p>The following order was issued by General
Pereira to the 1st Guards Brigade:</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="unindent"><span class="sc">2nd <abbr title="Battalion">Batt.</abbr> Grenadier Guards</span>&mdash;</p>

<p>You have again maintained the high traditions of
the 1st Guards Brigade when called upon a second time
in the battle of the Somme. For five days previous
to the assault the 2nd and 3rd Battalions Coldstream
Guards held the trenches under constant heavy shell-fire
and dug many hundred yards of assembly and communication
trenches, this work being constantly interrupted
by the enemy’s artillery. The 2nd Battalion
Grenadier Guards and 1st Battalion Irish Guards,
though under shell-fire in their bivouacs, were kept clear
of the trenches until the evening of 24th September,
and were given the task of carrying by assault all
the objectives to be carried by this Brigade. Nothing
deterred them in this attack, not even the fact that in
places the enemy wire was cut in the face of rifle and
machine-gun fire, and in spite of all resistance and
heavy losses the entire main enemy defensive line was
captured.</p>

<p><!--100.png--><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86"></a><span class="pageno">86</span>
Every battalion in the Brigade carried out its task
to the full.</p>

<p>The German Reserve Division, which includes the
238th, 239th, and 240th Regiments, and which opposed
you for many weeks at Ypres, left the salient on the
18th September. You have now met them in the open,
a worthy foe, but you have filled their trenches with
their dead and have driven them before you in headlong
flight.</p>

<p>I cannot say how proud I am to have had the honour
of commanding the 1st Guards Brigade in this battle,
a Brigade which has proved itself to be the finest in the
British Army.</p>

<p>The Brigade is now under orders for rest and training,
and it must now be our object to keep up the high
standard of efficiency, and those who have come to fill
our depleted ranks will strive their utmost to fill worthily
the place of those gallant officers and men who have
laid down their lives for a great cause.</p>

<p>On the night of the 12th the 2nd Guards
Brigade was ordered to relieve the right subsection
of the 3rd Guards Brigade. In the front
line was placed the 2nd Battalion Irish Guards,
with the 1st Battalion Scots Guards in support,
while the two battalions which were eventually
to undertake the attack, the 3rd Battalion
Grenadiers and 1st Battalion Coldstream, remained
behind in reserve. Orders were given to
the 2nd Battalion Irish Guards to clear away
isolated posts in front, where it was reported
that some Germans were lurking, and this was
successfully done; but an attack that was afterwards
organised with the 71st and 16th Infantry
Brigades was not quite so successful.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><abbr title="September">Sept.</abbr> 14.</p>

<p>Up to this point the 3rd Battalion Grenadiers
had stayed in reserve. Its packs, greatcoats,
and surplus kit were now sent into the Divisional
<!--102.png--><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88"></a><span class="pageno">88</span>
store at Méaulte, and bombs, sand-bags, tools,
flares, etc., issued to the men for the attack on the
following day. The Battalion marched off by
companies at 9 <span class="sc small">P.M.</span> to take up its position.</p>

<p>The following orders were issued by Brigadier-General
J. Ponsonby, commanding the 2nd
Guards Brigade:</p>

<div class="medium">
<p class="center"><span class="sc">2nd Guards Brigade</span></p>

<p class="p1">1. The Fourth Army will attack the enemy’s defences
between Combles Ravine and Martinpuich on Z day
with the object of seizing Morval, Lesbœufs, Gueudecourt,
Flers.</p>

<p>The French will attack simultaneously on the right,
and the Reserve Army on the left.</p>

<p>The attack is to be pushed with the utmost vigour
all along the line until the most distant objectives are
reached. The failure of a unit on the flank is not to
prevent other units from pushing on to their final
objective.</p>

<p>As soon as the final objectives have been captured
by the infantry, the cavalry will advance and will seize

<p class="p1">The first phase of the attack of the Guards
Division was to be carried out with Pereira’s
Brigade on the left and Ponsonby’s Brigade on
<!--109.png--><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95"></a><span class="pageno">95</span>
the right, while Corkran’s Brigade would be in
reserve. To the 2nd Brigade was allotted a
front of 500 yards, north-east of Ginchy, and the
attack was to be carried out by the 3rd Battalion
Grenadiers on the right with the 1st Battalion
Scots Guards in support, and the 1st Battalion
Coldstream on the left with the 2nd Battalion
Irish Guards in support. In order to evade the
heavy barrage which the Germans usually put
down along the east of Ginchy and Guillemont
villages, it was decided to assemble the whole
Brigade east of Ginchy.</p>

<p>This precaution had the advantage that the
assembly trench was not shelled, but there were
certain disadvantages. In the first place, the
assembly ground was not square with the line of
attack, so that a change of direction was necessary
after the attack had started, and, in the second
place, it was by no means easy to keep the 2nd
Guards Brigade in immediate touch with the
1st Guards Brigade. It had been intended to
align the Brigade on painted boards showing the
waves and the flanks of the platoons, but these
showed up so bright in the clear moonlight that
they were thrown away and men were put out as
markers instead.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><abbr title="September">Sept.</abbr> 15.</p>

<p>The 3rd Battalion Grenadiers was formed up
in four waves, all the men being in single rank,
and companies in columns of half-companies,
with fifty yards’ distance between platoons. Their
distribution was as follows:</p>

<p>At 4 <span class="sc small">A.M.</span> the Battalion was in position and
everything was ready. Sandwiches and an issue
of rum were served out to the men, who then
tried to snatch a little sleep. Complete silence
reigned, except for the sound of the tanks making
their way slowly to their places. At 6 <span class="sc small">A.M.</span>
exactly our heavy guns started, and fired about
forty shells apiece in quick succession. This
immediately woke up the enemy and brought
down their barrage in exactly the place where
it was expected, but of course there were no
troops there. Orders were passed down at 6.15
to fix bayonets and get ready, and five minutes
later the attack started.</p>

<p>The first objective or Green line lay over the
ridge about 600 yards away, and it was hoped
that this would be reached without any serious
opposition. The ground in and around Ginchy
was a battered mass of irregular ridges and shell-holes,
which overlapped and stretched away
into the early morning mist. Direction became
a matter of the greatest difficulty, as there were
absolutely no landmarks to go by. No one
except the Irish Guards had seen the ground
before, as it had been found impossible to send
officers up during the heavy fighting of the last
days. On the map it seemed a simple matter
to pick out the Lesbœufs road and the church
of Lesbœufs, either of which would have served
as a guide, but on the actual ground, which was
just a great desert of shell-holes, with our own
<!--111.png--><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97"></a><span class="pageno">97</span>
barrage ahead and the enemy’s shells falling
all round, it was practically impossible to distinguish
anything.</p>

<p>Soon after it started off the 3rd Battalion
Grenadiers came on unexpected intermediate
lines. These were no more than connected shell-holes,
but had served to shelter a number of
Germans, who fought with the utmost bravery.
The guns had not bombarded them, while the
creeping barrage had passed over too quickly
to do much harm. Though the men holding
them were all shot or bayoneted, and the delay
thus caused was very slight, it had the effect
of breaking the regularity of the formation and
telescoping up the men in the rear.</p>

<p>Almost at the outset Captain A. K. Mackenzie
was hit and fell, as he led his company to the
attack. Though mortally wounded, he got up
again and struggled on, still waving his men
forward. Once more he fell, and this time was
unable to rise, but even then he managed to
raise himself on one knee and cheer the company
on. Afterwards he was carried down on a
stretcher, but never recovered and died in the
ambulance on the way. About the same time
Lieutenant Raymond Asquith was shot through
the chest and killed as he led the first half of
<abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 4 Company. He had endeared himself to
both officers and men in an extraordinary degree
since he joined the regiment at the beginning of
the war, and his preference of service with his
Battalion to the good staff appointment which he
had just given up had won the admiration of all
ranks. Lieutenant E. H. J. Wynne was mortally
<!--112.png--><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98"></a><span class="pageno">98</span>
wounded by a German officer in one of the
intermediate lines, and Lieutenant C. G. Gardner
was killed soon afterwards. Captain G. G.
Gunnis, Lieutenant A. Whitehead, Second Lieutenant
H. Williams, and Second Lieutenant J.
Worsley were wounded.</p>

<p>While these intermediate lines were being
cleared, an extremely heavy machine-gun fire
was opened from the right flank, where the Sixth
Division had been held up at the start. The
tanks which were to have flattened out the wire
and helped the advance never appeared, and so
it came about that, from the moment it crossed
over the Ginchy ridge and came within view of
the enemy’s lines, the 2nd Guards Brigade was
committed to hard and continuous fighting in a
position of much difficulty.</p>

<p>By now the Brigade had got very much mixed
up, and, though still all together, continued its
advance as a brigade rather than as four battalions.
Whenever the leading wave met with
any check, those in rear, impatient to get at the
enemy, closed in on them, and thus companies
and even battalions became intermingled. As
an inevitable result of this quick advance the
right flank of the Brigade was completely exposed,
and <abbr title="Lieutenant">Lieut.</abbr>-Colonel Sergison-Brooke deciding that
some protection was essential, threw out a company
as a defensive flank to within 200 yards of
the enemy’s flanking trench, to keep down the
fire, while the rest of the 3rd Battalion Grenadiers
pressed on to the main assault.</p>

<p>It had been arranged that after the first
objective had been captured our artillery should
<!--113.png--><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99"></a><span class="pageno">99</span>
bombard the second objective and prepare it for
attack, so when these lines were carried there
was some uncertainty as to whether the advance
should be continued or not. In spite of the
casualties the 3rd Battalion Grenadiers, with the
1st Battalion Scots Guards, continued to push
on till it reached the first objective, and was
able to secure it according to the specified time,
though the task was no easy one. In some
parts between the right and left columns of the
assault, and also on the extreme right, the wire
had been untouched, but as soon as any man
gained a foothold in the trench he at once proceeded
to clear the way by bombing. Curiously
enough, though the Germans had fought with
such tenacity in the intermediate lines, the
garrison of the first objective offered comparatively
little resistance, and surrendered in large
numbers.</p>

<p>The men were out of breath, as the pace had
been hot, and they were carrying a good weight,
so a pause in this first objective was not unwelcome.
The prisoners were grouped together,
and sent back in batches; in one part of the
line the German machine-gunners caught sight of
them and turned their guns on them, but the
prisoners scurried off and ran as fast as they
could back through our lines.</p>

<p>On the right Captain Wolrige-Gordon with
<abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 1 Company was attempting to keep touch
with the Sixth Division, and as the Battalion
advanced he started firing down the enemy’s
trench where the machine-guns were holding
it up. At first the Germans were puzzled, but
<!--114.png--><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100"></a><span class="pageno">100</span>
when they grasped where the fire came from
their snipers got to work and accounted for
many men before Captain Wolrige-Gordon could
join the rest of the Battalion.</p>

<p>In the meantime the three battalions of
Coldstream advanced in a splendid manner,
carrying all before them. When men in line are
going forward with no reliable landmarks to
guide them, small incidents, quite insignificant
in themselves, will often cause a slight change of
direction without their being aware of it. On
starting off the 1st Battalion Coldstream met
with little resistance, and in its endeavour to
rush the foremost German trenches the left
flank of the Battalion moved ahead faster than
our creeping barrage. Quickly realising what
had happened, the men checked the pace and
hung back for a little, while the right flank of
the Battalion still pressed on. The check was
momentary, but caused the whole Battalion to
swing slightly to the left. This led the 2nd and
3rd Battalions Coldstream in the 1st Guards
Brigade also to ease off slightly to the left, and,
as often happens, the slight deviation was exaggerated
as the advance continued, and soon all
the Coldstream battalions were moving in a
northerly instead of a north-easterly direction.
A switch trench running at an angle into the
German main line gave them the impression
that they were going in the right direction, as
it seemed square with their advance. The 2nd
Battalion Irish Guards swung with the 1st
Battalion Coldstream, but the 1st Battalion Scots
Guards followed the 3rd Battalion Grenadiers.</p>

<p><!--115.png--><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101"></a><span class="pageno">101</span>
While this was happening the 2nd Battalion
Grenadiers from the 1st Guards Brigade, having
completely lost sight of the 2nd and 3rd Battalions
Coldstream as it passed through the
enemy’s barrage, continued to advance according
to its orders, and eventually forced its way to the
first objective, where to its surprise it found
itself between the 3rd Battalion Grenadiers and
the 1st Battalion Irish Guards.</p>

<p>The situation was most complicated, and yet
all was well. The Division, as a Division, had
swept everything in front of it, although not
quite in the order in which it should have
moved. But parts of the German trenches
remained untouched, and these had to be dealt
with before any farther progress could be made.
When the 1st Battalion Coldstream began to
swing to the left, a gap was made between the
two front battalions of the 2nd Guards Brigade,
which widened out as the advance progressed.
Observing this, Captain Oliver Lyttelton pushed
up 100 men of the 3rd Battalion Grenadiers
to fill the intermediate space, but as the gap
gradually extended, and the smoke and dust
made it impossible for them to see where they
were going, these hundred men were able to
keep touch with the 1st Battalion Coldstream
only, and became detached from the rest of the
Battalion.</p>

<p>Progress towards the first objective was made
very difficult by the failure of the Sixth Division
to take the Quadrilateral. As soon as the
attacking lines showed themselves they were
met by a sweeping fire from the enemy’s machine-guns
<!--116.png--><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102"></a><span class="pageno">102</span>
on the right flank, and were mown down.
After the first objective had been entered, and
<abbr title="Lieutenant">Lieut.</abbr>-Colonel Campbell, Coldstream Guards, was
organising an attack upon the second objective,
it was discovered that the whole of the first
objective was not entirely secured. An attack
was immediately made on that portion of the
line still occupied by the enemy, and <abbr title="Lieutenant">Lieut.</abbr>-Colonel
Guy Baring, who commanded the 1st
Battalion Coldstream, in attempting to gain
touch with the remainder of the Brigade from
which he had, for the moment, been separated,
left the trench to advance over the top of the
ground when he was struck by a bullet in the
head and instantly killed.</p>

<p><abbr title="Lieutenant">Lieut.</abbr>-Colonel Campbell then ordered Captain
Lyttelton to bomb down the trench together
with a party of the 2nd Irish Guards under
Lieutenant Mylne. But hardly had they started
when the Germans came running down the
trench, holding up their hands. They were
being pursued by another bombing party, composed,
not of the 3rd Battalion Grenadiers as
might have been expected, but the 2nd Battalion
Grenadiers.</p>

<p>Now that the whole of the first objective was
in our hands the advance towards the second
objective at once took place. On the extreme
right no ground could be gained, but farther
towards the centre the 3rd Battalion Grenadiers
reached a position which it assumed to be the
second objective, but was in fact, according to
the report from the aeroplanes, half-way between
the first and second objectives.</p>

<p><!--117.png--><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103"></a><span class="pageno">103</span>
During this last advance Captain Stanhope
and Second Lieutenant Jackson were killed.
Lieutenant W. Stainton was reported missing,
and there were several conflicting stories as to
what had happened to him. Second Lieutenants
Thrupp and Cassy were wounded, as well as
Second Lieutenant Cornish, who behaved with
great gallantry and was recommended for a
Military Cross.</p>

<p>As to whether it would have been possible
to push on at once into Lesbœufs, accounts
vary. Certainly those in front thought that
had reinforcements come up the town would
have fallen into our hands without further
opposition. It was not known, however, that
the right flank of the Division was absolutely
unprotected, and that the farther the Division
advanced the more perilous its position was
bound to become. Even if Lesbœufs had been
taken, it is difficult to believe that it could have
been held against counter-attacks with the right
flank thus in the air.</p>

<p>The sight of the Germans retiring hastily
towards Bapaume and withdrawing their field-guns
proved too tempting for some adventurous
spirits, and patrols were organised to press on
towards Lesbœufs. After consulting their maps,
Captain Sir Ian Colquhoun, 1st Battalion Scots
Guards, and Captain Lyttelton, 3rd Battalion
Grenadiers, determined to keep the Germans
in front of them on the move, and they were
joined soon after by Major Rocke, Captain
Alexander, and Lieutenant Mylne of the Irish
Guards. Sir Ian Colquhoun had already won
<!--118.png--><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104"></a><span class="pageno">104</span>
a reputation as the bravest of the brave, and
was credited with having killed a large number
of Germans in personal combat. The others
were very much of the same type&mdash;officers who
were never content with simply carrying out
their orders, but would instantly take advantage
of any weakness in the German defence to drive
a success home.</p>

<p>Having collected about twenty men, Sir Ian
Colquhoun pushed forward to reconnoitre towards
Lesbœufs, followed soon after by Major
Rocke and Captain Alexander with some men of
the Irish Guards. Captain Lyttelton called on
the men of the 3rd Battalion Grenadiers who
were near, and brought the whole party up to
about 120. This party pushed on, and met with
no opposition for 800 yards. At this stage they
found themselves in an unoccupied trench running
along the bottom of a little gully, with standing
crops in front of them. They could have pushed
on into Lesbœufs, but owing to their small
numbers and, as they expressed it, the ”draughtiness
of their flanks,” they decided to hold on
where they were and send back for reinforcements.
Messages were accordingly despatched
to the Brigade Headquarters, and were marked,
“To be read by all officers on the way.”</p>

<p>This daring attempt to capture more ground
from the enemy was quite a feasible operation,
but its success undoubtedly depended on
whether reinforcements could reach them before
the Germans returned. For so small a party
to try and do anything more than hold the
trench until an adequate force arrived would
<!--119.png--><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105"></a><span class="pageno">105</span>
have been madness. Every possible precaution
was taken against surprise, and Lewis guns were
placed on each flank. From 1 <span class="sc small">P.M.</span> onwards this
gallant little band waited and waited for the
reinforcements which never arrived. Meanwhile,
finding that the British attack had spent itself,
the Germans began returning in small bodies,
and soon after 5 <span class="sc small">P.M.</span> a whole battalion was seen
advancing. The position of this party was now
becoming serious. Gradually the Germans were
moving round each flank, and even getting to
their rear.</p>

<p>At 6 <span class="sc small">P.M.</span> they were still doggedly holding on
to their trench, being fired at from all sides,
when suddenly a company of the enemy, 250
strong, charged them in front. The surprise
was complete, as the standing crops hid the
Germans till the last moment. With 250 of the
enemy rushing a trench occupied by less than
100 British troops, one might have thought it
only a matter of time before our men were all
killed or taken prisoners. But the men who
had followed Major Rocke, Sir Ian Colquhoun,
and Captain Lyttelton were naturally stout
fighters, and when the order to retire was given
they actually contrived to disengage themselves
and get away, after killing a good number of
the enemy. Captain Lyttelton, finding himself
surrounded, threw his empty revolver at the
Germans; thinking it was a Mills bomb, they
ducked, and gave him time to scramble out of
the trench and escape.</p>

<p>Even then, had the Germans only stayed where
they were and fired at the retreating party, they
<!--120.png--><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106"></a><span class="pageno">106</span>
might have inflicted considerable losses, but
they came running on, firing from the shoulder,
and so allowed these gallant men to rejoin the
main British line with astonishingly few casualties.
When once they were safe, the pursuers
were greeted by such a deadly fire from our
trenches that numbers of them were killed, and
the rest scattered in all directions.</p>

<p>Meanwhile General Ponsonby pressed for the
3rd Guards Brigade to be sent up, but the reports
which reached General Feilding from the air
showed that the troops in front were not in the
positions ascribed to them, and as the situation
on both flanks of the Division was unsatisfactory,
and the Germans were reported to be massing
between Morval and Lesbœufs, he considered
that it would be impossible to throw forward all
his reserves. However, the 4th Battalion Grenadiers
was ordered to reinforce the 2nd Guards
Brigade, and told by General Ponsonby to
strengthen the right flank.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><abbr title="September">Sept.</abbr> 16.</p>

<p>All that night the right flank of the 2nd
Guards Brigade was being bombed, and Captain
J. Hopley, who behaved with great gallantry, at
one time had his men standing back to back and
firing both ways. The next day, September 16,
the 2nd Guards Brigade was relieved by the
61st Infantry Brigade, who continued the attack,
and secured the next objective.</p>

<p>The percentage of officers killed and wounded
in the 3rd Battalion Grenadiers was exceptionally
high; out of 22 officers who went into action, 17
were killed or wounded. <abbr title="Lieutenant">Lieut.</abbr>-Colonel Sergison-Brooke
was wounded almost at the start. Captain

and subsequently died; Captain F. J. V. B.

A. O. Whitehead, Second Lieutenant M. Thrupp,
Second Lieutenant D. W. Cassy, Second Lieutenant
G. M. Cornish, Second Lieutenant H. <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> J.
Williams, and Second Lieutenant J. F. Worsley
were wounded.</p>

<p>Amongst other ranks the casualties were 395
killed and wounded.</p>

<p>On September 20 the 3rd Battalion moved
into bivouacs at Carnoy, where it remained
until the second attack of the Guards Division
on the 25th. The 2nd Guards Brigade was then,
however, in reserve, and, owing to the complete
success of the attack, its services were not
required. The 3rd Battalion Grenadiers was in
Corps Reserve during the attack, but returned to
the Brigade in the evening. On the 26th Lieutenant
C. C. Carstairs and Second Lieutenant
C. F. Johnston joined.</p>

September 3. On the 8th the Brigade moved up
into the line and took over Ginchy, which had
just been captured by the Sixteenth Division. The

<p class="sidenote"><abbr title="September">Sept.</abbr>
10-11.</p>

<p>At 3.30 <span class="sc small">A.M.</span> on the 10th the 1st Battalion
Welsh Guards reported that it had completed
the relief of the 48th Brigade, and was digging
in on a line 200 yards east of the south-east
corner of Delville Wood to 100 yards north of
<!--123.png--><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109"></a><span class="pageno">109</span>
Ginchy on the Flers road, and 250 yards east
of the Lesbœufs road. Its left was in touch
with the 164th Brigade, but its right was in the
air. Meanwhile the 4th Battalion Grenadiers
was relieving the 47th Brigade between Guillemont
and Leuze Wood. But although both
these battalions were carrying out their orders
correctly, there was a gap of at least 600 yards
between them, owing doubtless to the fact that
the troops they had to relieve were not quite in
the positions they had been reported as occupying.
The 47th Brigade had been held up by the
Quadrilateral, while the 48th Brigade on its left
had advanced some distance.</p>

<p>On learning this, Brigadier-General Corkran
decided to employ some companies from the
battalions in reserve to fill up the gap, and
accordingly instructed <abbr title="Lieutenant">Lieut.</abbr>-Colonel Maitland to
send one company to support the 4th Battalion
Grenadiers and another company to the Welsh
Guards. <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 2 Company, under Captain Graham,
was despatched to Arrow Head Copse in support
of the 4th Battalion Grenadiers on the right of
the Brigade, and while going on ahead to find
<abbr title="Lieutenant">Lieut.</abbr>-Colonel Lord Henry Seymour, Lieutenant
E. King was hit by a rifle bullet in the leg,
and Lieutenant E. B. Shelley and Lieutenant
Llewellyn were wounded shortly afterwards.
Captain Vaughan, with <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 3 Company, was
instructed to place himself under the orders of
<abbr title="Lieutenant">Lieut.</abbr>-Colonel W. Murray-Threipland, while the
rest of the Battalion remained a little distance
behind in case of emergency.</p>

<p>Hardly had the Welsh Guards finished their
<!--124.png--><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110"></a><span class="pageno">110</span>
relief, when they were attacked, and had to fight
hard to maintain their position. Coming on in
great force as early as 3 <span class="sc small">A.M.</span>, the Germans began
to press back the right of their line from the
sunken road. Every available man had been
hurried to the front line, where the casualties were
thinning out the ranks to an alarming extent, and
even the 100 Grenadiers who had been sent up
as ammunition carriers had to be put in as
supports. The Welsh Guards had lost a good
many officers and <abbr title="Non Commissioned Officer">N.C.O.</abbr>’s, and matters were
beginning to look serious when Captain Vaughan
arrived with <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 3 Company of the 1st Battalion
Grenadiers, having passed through a barrage of
5·9 shells near Trônes Wood in artillery formation.
He was at once sent off by <abbr title="Lieutenant">Lieut.</abbr>-Colonel
Murray-Threipland to take over the line on the
right of the Welsh Guards and relieve the Munster
Fusiliers, who had had some very heavy fighting
and were much shaken. Second Lieutenant Stein
went on with the leading platoon, and the relief was
carried out by sections and completed by noon.</p>

<p>It was anything but a pleasant position, as
both flanks were in the air, and the Company
was occupying an extended front at right angles
to the trench occupied by the Welsh Guards.
Captain Vaughan was told that the attack would
probably come from the left, and made his dispositions
accordingly. He placed two sections in
shell-holes in échelon on the left, and established
a double block at that end of the trench with a
strong bombing section, supported by a Lewis
gun; the other Lewis gun he stationed on the
right flank. Second Lieutenant Sharp was in
<!--125.png--><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111"></a><span class="pageno">111</span>
charge of the left of the Company and Second
Lieutenant Stein of the right.</p>

<p>The day proved quiet and uneventful, the
enemy showing no inclination to advance, but
at 10 <span class="sc small">P.M.</span> their attack began. Coming on in
four waves, they not only succeeded in getting
between <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 3 Company and the Welsh Guards,
but even gained a footing in the front trench.
The Lewis gun on the left did excellent work,
but the men in the bombing post were all knocked
out. At the same time the Welsh Guards were
heavily attacked all down their line, and <abbr title="Lieutenant">Lieut.</abbr>-Colonel
Murray-Threipland sent a message to
Captain Vaughan to say that his front line was
falling back somewhere to the centre of Ginchy,
and asking him to fill up the gap between them
until reinforcements could be brought up. Captain
Vaughan replied that his left flank was in
contact with the enemy, and he could not,
therefore, throw back that flank, but that he
had double-locked the trench on that side; if
reinforcements did not reach him soon, he would
endeavour to protect his flanks as best he could.</p>

<p>This Company’s situation was now becoming
precarious. It had the enemy at each end of
a very long trench; enemy in front of it and
enemy behind it. It was short of bombs and
practically out of ammunition. At one time
it had some of the enemy actually in the
trench, but fortunately their bayonets were still
left to them, and not a German survived to
dispute possession with them. Apparently the
enemy did not know that this was an advanced
trench, thinly held; probably he thought it was
<!--126.png--><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112"></a><span class="pageno">112</span>
his old line 100 yards farther back. In any
case he found it a hard nut to crack, in spite
of his superior numbers and obvious advantages.
The men of <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 3 understood that if they gave
way it would go hard with the Welsh Guards,
and refused to yield an inch. Sergeant Whittaker
showed great courage and skill with the bombing
party, and was responsible for killing a large
number of Germans, as well as holding up the
enemy’s attack on the left.</p>

<p>Both Second Lieutenant Sharp and Second
Lieutenant Stein were wounded, in addition to
many <abbr title="Non Commissioned Officer">N.C.O.</abbr>’s, and 56 men in all were killed,
but the rest fought on and made it plain to the
enemy that they had no intention of retiring.
When the ground was afterwards cleared, over
100 Germans were found dead in front of the
trench, amongst them being a captain named
von Hahen and two other officers. Throughout
this difficult operation Captain Vaughan directed
the proceedings with great coolness, and his
messages were clear, precise, and cheerful. His
stubborn defence of his trench undoubtedly saved
the Welsh Guards from being surrounded.</p>

General Corkran in the meantime sent up two
companies of the 2nd Battalion Scots Guards
to the assistance of the Welsh Guards, and
they arrived at 3.30 <span class="sc small">P.M.</span> The remaining companies
of the 1st Battalion Grenadiers were
despatched to Guillemont, while the rest of the
Scots Guards took their place near Bernafay
Wood. After continuous fighting the Welsh
Guards had managed to straighten their line,
and Captain Ashton of that regiment organised
some bombing attacks, and regained all the
ground lost during the day. About midnight on
the 11th the Welsh Guards were relieved by the
2nd Battalion Scots Guards.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the King’s Company 1st Battalion
Grenadiers, under Captain Drury-Lowe, moved
into the line to fill up the gap between the left
of <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 3 Company and the 2nd Battalion Scots
Guards, which now occupied the line originally
held by the Welsh Guards. In carrying out
this operation the King’s Company captured
fifty German prisoners. <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 4 Company, under
Captain L. G. Fisher-Rowe, moved into the line on
the left of the Scots Guards to fill up another gap
there. Second Lieutenant Stourton was wounded
in the shoulder while in charge of the carrying
party of 100 men that went into the line early
that afternoon.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><abbr title="September">Sept.</abbr> 12.</p>

<p>At 2 <span class="sc small">A.M.</span> <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 2 Company, under Captain A. C.
Graham, was ordered to bomb along a trench
running east from the right of <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 3 Company
along the south side of the Ginchy Telegraph
Road, and attack the Quadrilateral. At that time
it was not known how strongly this point was
held. The formation of the bombing attack was:</p>

Each bombing party was composed as follows:</p>

<p class="indent2">2 bayonet men carrying 6 bombs each.</p>
<p class="p0 indent2">1 thrower carrying 6 bombs.</p>
<p class="p0 indent2">2 carriers carrying 12 bombs each.</p>

<p>Every man in the Company carried 4 Mills

found the Lewis gun to cover the left.</p>

<p>All the ground had been obliterated by shells,
and <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 2 Company found its line with some
difficulty and advanced to within 100 yards of the
Quadrilateral, where it was held up by machine-gun
fire. Captain Graham was killed by a shell
during the advance, and Captain Fisher-Rowe
took his place, but among other ranks the
casualties were not heavy. There was nothing
more to be done but to block the trench as far as
they had got and consolidate the line. At 6 <span class="sc small">A.M.</span>
the whole Battalion made another attack, and
attempted to seize the Quadrilateral in conjunction
with the Fifty-sixth Division, but the
place proved too strong. This time the Battalion
lost heavily; Lieutenant A. V. L. Corry was
killed, and there was a large number of casualties
among the other ranks.</p>

<p>Next day the 1st Battalion Grenadiers was
relieved at 2 <span class="sc small">A.M.</span> by the 2nd Battalion Irish
Guards, and went into camp at Happy Valley.</p>

<p>That afternoon there was a conference of
Commanding Officers, when General Corkran explained
the dispositions for the impending attack.
The 1st and 2nd Guards Brigades were to attack
on the 15th, while the 3rd Guards Brigade would
be in reserve. The orders issued by Brigadier-General
Corkran are given below.</p>

Gueudecourt, and Flers, and breaking through
the enemy’s system of defence.</p>

<p>The French are attacking simultaneously on the
south and the Reserve Army on the north.</p>

<p>The Eighth Division are attacking on the right of the
Guards Division and the Fourteenth on the left. The
Division is attacking with the 2nd Guards Brigade on
the right and the 1st Guards Brigade on the left. The
forming-up areas are shown on the map issued to the
C.O.’s. Tanks will be employed to co-operate with the
attack. Information regarding their employment is
forwarded separately.</p>

<p>2. The 3rd Guards Brigade will be in Divisional
Reserve, and will be formed up on the night of the
14/15th <abbr title="September">Sept.</abbr> in and east of Trônes Wood as follows:</p>

<p>4. (<i>a</i>) If the attack is completely successful, the rôle

fourth objective. The cavalry will not enter villages.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Should the attack be partially successful and

<p>On the 14th the 1st Battalion Grenadiers
marched to Carnoy and then to Trônes Wood,
where it spent the night huddled together in shell-holes.
It was so bitterly cold that it was difficult
to get any sleep, and next morning every one
was chilled to the bone. The ”wood” consisted
of trunks of trees blackened by shell-fire, the
upper parts having been shot away; they were
quite leafless, and the splintered branches lay
all tangled over the shell craters. Amongst the
wreckage were shapeless bodies in khaki and
grey; some almost skeletons, and others with
the skin stretched over the bones and tanned
like leather. Flying about among the bare trees
were half-a-dozen magpies, the only occupants
of the wood. All was quiet, when suddenly
our barrage began, followed by the German one,
and soon the noise was terrific.</p>

<p>With the rest of the 3rd Guards Brigade, the
1st Battalion Grenadiers advanced to a position
south-west of Ginchy in artillery formation, and
<!--134.png--><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118"></a><span class="pageno">118</span>
proceeded to strengthen the line of trenches
there. The Brigade was to support the attack
of the other two brigades, or to counter any
hostile movements against the right flank of the
Division, which was in the air, as the Sixth
Division had been held up by the Quadrilateral.
The 4th Battalion Grenadiers and 2nd Battalion
Scots Guards accordingly moved up to a position
about half-a-mile north of Ginchy, while the
1st Battalion Grenadiers and 1st Battalion Welsh
Guards took their places south-west of that
village, and were employed most of the day in
supplying carrying parties for the other two
brigades.</p>

<p>Second Lieutenant L. G. E. Sim and 100 men
of <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 3 Company did particularly good work in
carrying up ammunition and materials under fire
to the battalions in the front line of trenches.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Samuelson was sent forward that
night by <abbr title="Lieutenant">Lieut.</abbr>-Colonel Maitland to ascertain
where the leading line had got to, so that he
might know exactly the position occupied by the
1st and 2nd Guards Brigades. After stumbling
about for three-quarters of an hour he reached the
trench indicated by the guides, but it was deserted
except for a few wounded. So he had to push
on still farther, and eventually found the front
trench occupied by a mixed mass of men of the
Guards Division.</p>

<p>He reported this to <abbr title="Lieutenant">Lieut.</abbr>-Colonel Maitland,
who gave orders for the King’s Company under
Captain Drury-Lowe, and <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 4 Company under
Captain Fisher-Rowe, to advance through Ginchy.
There were apparently no guides, and after
passing south of Ginchy these two companies
advanced towards the front line until they met
<abbr title="Lieutenant">Lieut.</abbr>-Colonel Murray-Threipland, who told them
there were no unoccupied trenches in front.
They therefore returned to their original position,
having unluckily lost five <abbr title="Non Commissioned Officer">N.C.O.</abbr>’s, who were
killed or wounded by a single shell that pitched
in their midst.</p>

<p>At 9 <span class="sc small">A.M.</span> the order came for the 1st Battalion
to move up so as to be ready to attack with the
rest of the 3rd Guards Brigade. Having joined
the other battalion, the 1st Battalion Grenadiers
reached a position just behind the starting-point
at 11.15 <span class="sc small">A.M.</span> The 3rd Guards Brigade, with the
1st Battalion Grenadiers on the right, the 1st
Battalion Welsh Guards on the left, and the 4th
Battalion Grenadiers in support, was ordered to
pass through the battalions in the front line
and attack the previous day’s third objective,
or Blue line, but all the Commanding Officers
raised a protest against an advance unsupported
in any way by artillery fire, and General Corkran
reported this back to the Divisional Headquarters.
The protest was overruled, and the attack was
ordered to begin at once. The 1st Battalion
Grenadiers reached the high ground west of
Lesbœufs, but was met with heavy machine-gun
fire, opened on it from the church tower and other
strong points. Second Lieutenant Sim was killed,
and Second Lieutenant Samuelson wounded, in
addition to some casualties among other ranks.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><abbr title="September">Sept.</abbr>
17-19.</p>

<p>Orders were given to consolidate the position
which had been reached, and the 1st Battalion,
having been relieved by the 59th Infantry
<!--138.png--><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120"></a><span class="pageno">120</span>
Brigade, returned to bivouacs in Carnoy. On
the 18th Major A. F. A. N. Thorne, <abbr title="Distinguished Service Order">D.S.O.</abbr>, left
to take command of the 3rd Battalion, and
Lieutenant C. H. C. Healy and Lieutenant W. J.
Dashwood joined.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><abbr title="September">Sept.</abbr> 19-24.</p>

<p>On the 20th the 1st Battalion Grenadiers
marched to the trenches west of Lesbœufs and
remained there till the next day, when it was
relieved by the 3rd Battalion Coldstream. Lieutenant
Dashwood was wounded while his Company
was going into the front line. On the
24th the 1st Battalion left Trônes Wood and
marched to the assembly trenches in preparation
for the attack next day, for which Brigadier-General
Corkran issued the following orders:</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="sc">3rd Guards Brigade</span></p>

<div class="medium">
<p class="p1 center"><i>Operation Order, <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 66</i></p>

<p class="p1">1. The Fourth Army will renew the attack on the
25th <abbr title="September">Sept.</abbr> in combination with the attacks by the
French in the south and the Reserve Army in the north.
The Guards Division will capture Lesbœufs. The
1st Guards Brigade will attack on the right and the
3rd Guards Brigade on the left. The Fifth Division
will attack Morval on the right and the Twenty-first
Division (62nd Brigade) will attack Gueudecourt on the
left of the Guards Division.</p>

<p>2. <i>Objectives.</i>&mdash;The objectives, assembly trenches,
and dividing line between brigades and divisions are
marked on attached map.</p>

<p class="indent2">The first objective Green.</p>
<p class="p0 indent2">The second objective Brown.</p>
<p class="p0 indent2">The third objective Blue.</p>

<p>The 2nd <abbr title="Battalion">Batt.</abbr> Scots Guards and the 4th <abbr title="Battalion">Batt.</abbr>
Grenadiers will capture the first and second objectives,
<!--139.png--><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121"></a><span class="pageno">121</span>
and will advance in two waves on a front of two companies
each. The 2nd <abbr title="Battalion">Batt.</abbr> Scots Guards will attack
on the right and the 4th <abbr title="Battalion">Batt.</abbr> Grenadiers on the left.</p>

<p>The 1st <abbr title="Battalion">Batt.</abbr> Grenadiers will pass through the two
leading battalions and capture the third objective.
The 1st <abbr title="Battalion">Batt.</abbr> Welsh Guards, less two companies, will
be held in Brigade Reserve in T.8.a.</p>

<p>3. <i>The Assault.</i>&mdash;The 2nd <abbr title="Battalion">Batt.</abbr> Scots Guards and
4th <abbr title="Battalion">Batt.</abbr> Grenadiers will be formed up in X and Y
trenches, and will advance to the attack of the first
objective at zero hour close up to their barrage. There
are two hostile lines to cross before the objective is
reached, the first being from T.2.b.97 to T.8.b.3.10,
and the second in the main German Brown line.</p>

<p>These two battalions will reorganise in the first
objective and advance to the attack of the second
objective at zero + 1 hour.</p>

<p>The left of the 2nd <abbr title="Battalion">Batt.</abbr> Scots Guards will direct.
The 1st <abbr title="Battalion">Batt.</abbr> Grenadiers will be formed up in Z trench
and will advance so as to reach the first objective at
zero hour + 1 hour. The Battalion will advance to
the attack of the third objective so as to reach their
barrage 200 yards beyond the second objective at zero
+ 2 hours.</p>

<p>Two companies of the 1st <abbr title="Battalion">Batt.</abbr> Welsh Guards will
be formed up in T.8.a, and will move into X line so as
to be ready to occupy the first objective as soon as the
1st <abbr title="Battalion">Batt.</abbr> Grenadiers leave that line. In timing their
advance to the X line these two companies will seize
opportunities offered by any slackening of the hostile
barrage.</p>

<p>4. <i>Consolidation.</i>&mdash;The 4th <abbr title="Battalion">Batt.</abbr> Grenadiers and
2nd <abbr title="Battalion">Batt.</abbr> Scots Guards will consolidate the second
objective. At zero hour + 2 hours the 4th Grenadiers
will push a unit forward by the sunken road in N.33.b
and d and consolidate a strong point at the northern
end, obtaining touch with the 62nd Infantry Brigade.
The Battalion will also consolidate a strong point on
<!--140.png--><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122"></a><span class="pageno">122</span>
the left of the second objective. The <abbr title="Officer Commanding">O.C.</abbr> 2nd <abbr title="Battalion">Batt.</abbr>
Scots Guards will detail one company to push forward
at zero hour + 2 hours on his right flank and consolidate
a strong point to protect the right rear of the 1st <abbr title="Battalion">Batt.</abbr>
Grenadiers against attack from the south.</p>

<p>Two companies of the 1st <abbr title="Battalion">Batt.</abbr> Welsh Guards will
consolidate the first objective, making a strong point
on the left flank of that objective and at N.32.d.8.3,
and maintaining touch with the 62nd Infantry Brigade.</p>

<p>In the event of the Brigades on our right and left
being held up, defensive flanks will be formed. As soon
as the situation demands, half a battalion will be
advanced to the sunken road in R.34.a and d.</p>

<p>5. <i>Preliminary Movement.</i>&mdash;Battalions will be moved
up to the assembly positions on the night of the
24/25th September. The 1st <abbr title="Battalion">Batt.</abbr> Grenadiers will not
move before 10 <span class="sc small">P.M.</span></p>

<p>Assaulting battalions will cut any wire in front of
our trenches on the night of the 24/25th September.
Wire-cutters can be drawn at Guillemont station if
required. Units will report when they have reached
their assembly positions as detailed above on the night
of the 24/25th September; special relief of 1st <abbr title="Battalion">Batt.</abbr>
Welsh Guards will be arranged direct between <abbr title="Officer Commanding">O.C.</abbr>

<p>The first objective or Green line was the last
German trench running north and south, well in

was a sunken road with dug-outs about 800 yards

<p>The other officers, and the Sergeant-Major,
Drill-Sergeants, Company Sergeant-Majors, and
Company Quartermaster-Sergeants remained with
the Transport.</p>

<p>Exactly at 12.35 <span class="sc small">P.M.</span> the assault began, and
the 3rd Guards Brigade advanced to the attack
with the 2nd Battalion Scots Guards on the
right and the 4th Battalion Grenadiers on the
left. The first and second objectives were secured
with comparatively little loss, considering the
strength of the German lines.</p>

<p>With mathematical precision the 1st Battalion
started off, and advanced in column of platoons
in fours, so as to be close up when the moment
arrived for it to pass through the leading battalions
at the second objective. The order from
<!--142.png--><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124"></a><span class="pageno">124</span>
right to left was&mdash;the King’s Company, <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 2,
<abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 4, and <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 3. The German artillery at once
directed a barrage on them with considerable
accuracy, causing a number of casualties. Necessarily
the advance was slow, but the military
precision with which every order was carried out
under this shell-fire was truly remarkable. It
might have been a Wimbledon field-day, judging
by the cool way in which the non-commissioned
officers gave their orders, interposed with cautions
such as “Steady by the right,” etc. And all
the while the shells were falling and exploding
hideously.</p>

<p>On arrival at the Green line the 1st Battalion
had to wait for some time, and spent it in digging
itself farther in, pressing into the service
some remaining terrified Germans who had been
found alive. The men were all eager to get on,
and fretted at being left so long in this trench.
At last the moment arrived for the Battalion to
continue the advance, and again it moved on in
a line.</p>

<p>The first two objectives had been taken by the
Battalions in front, and the moment had arrived
for the 1st Battalion Grenadiers, to which had
been entrusted the attack on the third objective
and the capture of Lesbœufs, to pass through the
front line and continue the advance. It was
faced with the usual problem in such attacks&mdash;how
to guard the flanks of a successful attacking
force when the neighbouring division is held up.
In this case it was the left flank which remained
in the air, and although the 1st Battalion Welsh
Guards was forming a protective flank, the 1st
<!--143.png--><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125"></a><span class="pageno">125</span>
Battalion Grenadiers was subjected to a cruel
enfilade fire. Simultaneously on the right the
leading battalion of the 1st Guards Brigade was
advancing towards the third objective.</p>

<p>The order in which the 1st Battalion attacked
was now slightly changed: the King’s Company
under Captain Drury-Lowe was still on the right,
but <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 2 came under Captain Sheppard next,
with <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 4 under Lieutenant Lawford in support.
<abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 3 Company under Lieutenant Swift was
nearest to the enfilade fire, and found it necessary
to swing to the left, in order to face the machine-guns
which were causing so many casualties.
Both Lieutenant Swift and Lieutenant Harvard,
the only two officers with this company, were
wounded, in addition to Lieutenant Flower, and
the casualties among other ranks were very heavy.</p>

<p>With the forward progress of the Battalion
the menace to the left flank increased, and Captain
Sheppard threw back his left flank to protect the
advance, but this naturally made it difficult for
him to keep pace with the King’s Company. <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 4
Company under Lieutenant Lawford was therefore
ordered to come up between the King’s and <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 2
Companies, and the advance continued in perfect
lines, never hesitating for a moment in the face of
a terrific fire. Lieutenant Healy was wounded,
and Sergeant Brooks, who led <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 14 Platoon, behaved
with great coolness and gallantry, although
all his men but two were killed or wounded.
He himself was not touched in the morning, but
later in the afternoon had his right hand and wrist
blown off by a shell. Sergeant Martin, who was
in charge of a Lewis gun, had all his team knocked
<!--144.png--><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126"></a><span class="pageno">126</span>
out, but borrowed some men from <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 2 Company,
and kept his gun in action for the rest of the day.
He was afterwards awarded the <abbr title="Distinguished Combat Medal">D.C.M.</abbr></p>

<p>As the King’s Company advanced and took
the third objective, its Commander, Captain
Drury-Lowe, was killed by a shell, while he
was consulting Captain Hargreaves of the Irish
Guards. He had already gained the <abbr title="Distinguished Service Order">D.S.O.</abbr> in
the artillery battery, in which he had fought all
through the first years of the war, and would
no doubt have earned further distinction had he
lived, for he was a man without fear and a worthy
commander of the King’s Company. Lieutenant
P. M. Spence took command, and directly the
Blue line had been secured, ordered the men to
dig themselves in, which they did, in a narrow
and deep trench.</p>

<p>In order to protect the left flank. General
Corkran sent up two companies of the Welsh
Guards to watch the left of the Division, and as
soon as these arrived <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 3 Company of the 1st
Battalion Grenadiers under Lieutenant Pauling,
who had been sent up to take charge of this
Company, now without officers, was once more
free to join the rest of the Battalion. When it
reached the front line it was ordered to form a
strong point 400 yards in front of the junction of
<abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 2 and <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 4 Companies. Strong patrols were
sent out to deal with any of the enemy’s snipers
who might still be lurking about in front, and
they continued their search well into the night.
One patrol under Sergeant Carter did particularly
well, and managed to secure a German map
showing all their dispositions. Application was
<!--145.png--><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127"></a><span class="pageno">127</span>
made that evening to the Guards Division Headquarters
for the cavalry to come through, but
this was refused on reference to Lord Cavan, on
the ground that the situation on the flanks of the
Division was still very uncertain.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><abbr title="September">Sept.</abbr> 26.</p>

<p>On the 26th the Germans shelled Lesbœufs
with their heavy guns, but the trenches that had
been dug were good and little harm was done.
No counter-attack was made by the enemy, and
that night the 1st Battalion Grenadiers was
relieved by the 1st Battalion Scots Guards, and
returned to bivouacs at Carnoy.</p>

<p>The total casualties in the 1st Battalion during
the consolidation of Ginchy and the two attacks
were: officers, killed 4, wounded 12, total 16;
other ranks, killed 80, wounded 431, missing 84,
total 595.</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="sc">The 4th Battalion</span></p>

<p class="p1">After a course of training with the other
battalions of the 3rd Guards Brigade, the 4th
Battalion Grenadiers moved up in omnibuses
to the neighbourhood of Carnoy, where it was
employed in repairing a road running from Carnoy
to Wedge Wood. When this work was finished,
it bivouacked in shelters near Talus Boise, about
two and a half miles west of Leuze Wood.
On September 9 Captain Mitchell left to take up
an appointment at the Central Training School
at Havre.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><abbr title="September">Sept.</abbr> 9.</p>

<p>On the evening of the 9th the 4th Battalion
was sent up to relieve the 47th Brigade, which
had just attacked, while the Welsh Guards
<!--146.png--><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128"></a><span class="pageno">128</span>
took the place of the 48th Brigade. As the
attack had succeeded in some places and failed
in others, the front line ran in an irregular
pattern; in some parts large dents had been
knocked in the German line, but in others we had
made no progress at all. In the particular section
of the line which the 3rd Guards Brigade was to
relieve, the 48th Brigade, on the left, had secured
all its objectives, but the 47th Brigade, in the
centre, had the misfortune to find itself opposite
the Quadrilateral. It could not be blamed for
failing to advance, for the Quadrilateral was one
of the strongest points in the enemy’s line, and
contained eight machine-guns. Hence its losses
were very heavy and it was quite unable to
make any headway. On the other hand, the
167th Brigade on its right had been completely
successful, and had gone well forward. So at
the close of this attack the left of the 167th
Brigade and the right of the 48th Brigade were
in the air, with a space of 600 yards between the
two still in the hands of the enemy.</p>

<p>About midnight the 4th Battalion made its
way slowly towards Trônes Wood, and took over
the line occupied by what was left of the 47th
Brigade between Guillemont and Leuze Wood,
with its left on the Wedge Wood Road, 500
yards south of Ginchy. The Battalion advanced
across country under a light shell-fire, leaving
Guillemont immediately on its left, and heading
direct for Ginchy. On reaching its destination
<abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 1 Company got touch with the supports of
the 167th Brigade on the right; <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 2 came
next, and <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 3 was on the left, while <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 4
<!--147.png--><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129"></a><span class="pageno">129</span>
remained in support with the Battalion Headquarters.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><abbr title="September">Sept.</abbr> 10.</p>

<p>The relief was complete by 5 <span class="sc small">A.M.</span>, and patrols
were sent out in the thick morning mist to try
and locate the enemy. In the trenches that were
taken over lay heaps of wounded and dying men,
some of whom had been there for five days.
There was constant sniping by the enemy in front,
and patrols from both sides continually met in
No Man’s Land (which varied from 80 to 200
yards in width); often neither party knew
whether the others were friends or foes. It was
difficult for officers commanding companies to
send in any clear report of the situation, as whole
trenches had been obliterated and the position
on both flanks was most obscure. Meanwhile
the incessant sniping and shell-fire made any
movement almost impossible.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><abbr title="September">Sept.</abbr> 11.</p>

<p>As will have been seen in the account of the
1st Battalion, General Corkran tried to remedy
this very unsatisfactory state of things by sending
up <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 3 Company from the 1st Battalion Grenadiers
to support the Welsh Guards, and <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 2
Company to the 4th Battalion Grenadiers. It
was reported at the time that the Quadrilateral
was thinly held by a small garrison, which was
only waiting for a suitable opportunity to surrender.
Nothing further from the truth could
well have been imagined, as the 4th Battalion
soon discovered. Orders had been sent from
Brigade Headquarters for the 4th Battalion to
push up north and get touch with the 1st Battalion
Welsh Guards, the impression being that these
two battalions were in line; but since the Welsh
<!--148.png--><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130"></a><span class="pageno">130</span>
Guards were 600 yards in front of the Grenadiers’
position, it was impossible to carry out these
instructions.</p>

<p><abbr title="Lieutenant">Lieut.</abbr>-Colonel Lord Henry Seymour did his
best, and ordered <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 3 Company under Captain
Stewart to move off to the left, its place in
the line being taken by <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 4 under Captain
E. Spencer-Churchill. Captain Stewart eventually
got touch with a company of the 2nd Battalion
Scots Guards, which had been sent up in
support of the Welsh Guards. Noticing this
movement of troops, the enemy imagined that
an attack was in preparation, and sent up a
succession of lights, presumably to call for a
barrage. In answer to these signals the German
artillery despatched a regular flow of 5·9 shells,
and one pitched in the trench occupied by the
4th Battalion Grenadiers; Second Lieutenant
R. F. C. Tompson and Sergeant Todd of <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 4
Company were killed, and Captain C. G. Goschen
of <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 1 Company was wounded very slightly
in the face. All that day the Welsh Guards
in their advanced position were very heavily
attacked, but managed to retain their trenches
with the help of a company from the 1st Battalion
Grenadiers.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><abbr title="September">Sept.</abbr> 12.</p>

<p>An attempt was made at 1 o’clock next
morning to secure the Quadrilateral, and <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 2
Company from the 1st Battalion carried out a
bombing attack; this proved unsuccessful, and
Captain Graham, Lieutenant Corry, and a number
of other ranks were killed. <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 4 Company
from the 4th Battalion went up in support, but
as it was found impossible to advance beyond
<!--149.png--><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131"></a><span class="pageno">131</span>
a certain point, its services were not required.
At 3 <span class="sc small">A.M.</span> the 4th Battalion was relieved by a
battalion of the Suffolk Regiment, and <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 2 and
<abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 4 Companies were placed at the disposal of
the officer commanding the 1st Battalion Welsh
Guards, while <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 1 and <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 3 Companies retired
to Bernafay Wood, which they reached at
5.30 <span class="sc small">A.M.</span> While <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 2 Company was moving up
to support the Welsh Guards, Lieutenant R. Y. T.
Kendall was wounded, being shot through the
lungs.</p>

<p>In the course of the day efforts were made to
connect the various parts of the line, and the
1st Battalion Grenadiers and 2nd Battalion Scots
Guards were sent up by companies to strengthen
the weaker portions. By the evening the line,
though not by any means straight, had been
joined together in one continuous trench. Even
when <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 2 and <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 4 Companies got to Trônes
Wood they were still under very heavy shell-fire.
Captain Spencer-Churchill reported this by telephone
to the Brigade-Major, who inquired whether
he wanted any retaliation. “Very much,” replied
Captain Spencer-Churchill, and instructions
were accordingly given. The effect was wonderful,
and after a few minutes the German artillery
turned their attention to another part of the line.
Later on <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 3 Company was sent up and placed
at the disposal of the <abbr title="Officer Commanding">O.C.</abbr> 1st Battalion Grenadiers.
At 10 <span class="sc small">P.M.</span> the 4th Battalion Grenadiers
was relieved by the 1st Battalion Scots Guards and
marched back to Happy Valley Camp, remaining
there until the 14th.</p>

<p>During the evening of the 14th the Battalion
<!--150.png--><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132"></a><span class="pageno">132</span>
moved to Carnoy, and afterwards to a small copse
east of Trônes Wood, where it stayed till the
following morning.</p>

in the attack of the 15th were:</p>

<p>The attack started at 6.20 <span class="sc small">A.M.</span>, and the 1st
and 2nd Guards Brigades advanced with the 3rd
Guards Brigade in reserve. After some waiting
news was brought down to the 3rd Brigade by the
wounded that the first objective had been secured,
and about 9 <span class="sc small">A.M.</span> the Brigade received orders to
move up to a position north of Ginchy, and be
prepared to support the attack or counter any
hostile movement against the right flank of the
Division. Originally it had been intended that
the 4th Battalion Grenadiers should pass through
the rows of massed field-guns, but when the guns
began an intense fire this was obviously impossible,
and orders were therefore issued for the Battalion
<!--151.png--><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133"></a><span class="pageno">133</span>
to move by platoons at 100 yards’ interval along
the old railway. The advance was made with the
4th Battalion Grenadiers on the right and the
2nd Battalion Scots Guards on the left, and they
reached trenches near Ginchy in comparative
safety, as the German barrage did not extend so
far back.</p>

<p>Second Lieutenant Keith from <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 2 Company
and Second Lieutenant Farquhar from <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 3
were sent on to locate and report on a position
on the other side of Ginchy, to which the Battalion
was to move later. On their return the
two battalions moved forward, and passed over
what had been the first objective of the two
leading brigades, where heaps of dead Germans
remained as evidence of the recent fighting. On
arrival at their destination 500 yards north of
Ginchy, the two battalions dug in in a defensive
position, with a support line facing half right.
In the line was a stranded tank whose commander
claimed to have destroyed two of the enemy’s
machine-guns. It was hopelessly stuck, and, after
the crew had spent most of the day vainly trying
to move it, was eventually used to provide excellent
cover for a dug-out which was constructed
underneath it. At 5 <span class="sc small">P.M.</span>, by order of General
Feilding, the 4th Battalion Grenadiers was
placed under the command of the <abbr title="General Officer Commanding">G.O.C.</abbr> 1st
Guards Brigade, and the 2nd Battalion Scots
Guards under the <abbr title="General Officer Commanding">G.O.C.</abbr> 2nd Guards Brigade.
It was rather disappointing for the 3rd Guards
Brigade to be split up in this way instead of going
in as a brigade, but of course the situation in front
was not known to those who were in reserve.</p>

<p><!--152.png--><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134"></a><span class="pageno">134</span>
At this moment <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 3 Company under Captain
Stewart and <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 4 under Captain Spencer-Churchill
were sent forward through the German
barrage to protect the flanks of the 2nd Battalion
Grenadiers in the 1st Brigade. <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 4 Company
moved up to an empty trench which it explored
as far as it went to the right, and there
found a company of the Durham Light Infantry,
led by a most gallant officer, a captain, who was
killed soon afterwards by a German bomb.
In order to expedite matters, Captain Spencer-Churchill
sent twenty to thirty men over the top
to co-operate with the party working down the
trench, and the Germans were soon driven back
some distance. Meanwhile <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 3 Company had
gone to strengthen the left of the line held by the
2nd Battalion. These two companies remained
in their position during the night of the 15th,
while <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 1 and <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 2 stayed near Ginchy with
the Battalion Headquarters.</p>

<p>Next morning <abbr title="Lieutenant">Lieut.</abbr>-Colonel Lord Henry
Seymour was ordered to withdraw one company
from the line, and sent a message to <abbr title="Lieutenant">Lieut.</abbr>-Colonel
de Crespigny, asking him whether he would prefer
to keep <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 4 Company on his right or <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 3 on
his left. He decided to keep <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 3, and Captain
Spencer-Churchill accordingly brought his Company
back to Headquarters. While moving back
through the barrage with <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 4 Company,
Lieutenant Abel-Smith was wounded in the
arm, and there were about seventy casualties
among other ranks. Second Lieutenant R.
Gault, in charge of the sapping platoon, went
up to help the 2nd Battalion, and while putting
<!--153.png--><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135"></a><span class="pageno">135</span>
out posts in front of the line was shot through
the head. Instructions were given for Corkran’s
Brigade to pass through the leading brigades
and continue the attack on the third objective,
but owing to a protest having been referred
back to the Corps Commander, the actual attack
did not start until 1.15. The 1st Battalion
Grenadiers and 1st Battalion Welsh Guards
carried it out, with <abbr title="Numbers">Nos.</abbr> 2 and 3 Companies
from the 4th Battalion Grenadiers in support.
But this advance was soon held up by the enemy’s
machine-guns, and the battalions were told to
dig in where they were. <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 3 Company from
the 4th Battalion took part in the operation, and
Sergeant Higgins particularly distinguished himself
by clearing the Germans out of a trench and
killing several single-handed.</p>

<p>That night Corkran’s Brigade was relieved by
the Twentieth Division and returned to Carnoy.
There it remained in bivouacs until the 20th,
when it returned to the line just north of Ginchy.
On the 18th Second Lieutenant H. C. S. Maine
joined from the entrenching battalion, and on
the 19th Second Lieutenant A. R. Ellice and a
draft of thirty men arrived.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><abbr title="September">Sept.</abbr> 20.</p>

<p>Going up to the trenches in front of Lesbœufs
at 7 <span class="sc small">P.M.</span> on the 20th to dig communication and
assembly trenches for the attack of the 25th, the
4th Battalion had what seemed an interminable
march, owing to the congestion of the traffic and
the bad state of the ground. The only available
road was one mass of transport, guns, etc., and so
deep was the mud in some places that it was
difficult to cover more than half-a-mile an hour.
<!--154.png--><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136"></a><span class="pageno">136</span>
To make matters worse the guides who had been
supplied lost their way, and it was not till three
o’clock next morning that the relief was complete.
The front-line trench was very shallow, and not
by any means bullet-proof, while the communication
trench called Gas Alley was filled with
British and German corpses.</p>

<p>Captain Spencer-Churchill was ordered to go
with his company to Gas Alley and dig a trench
connecting it with the one on the right, the exact
position of which was not known. He was told
that the shell-holes round the block in Gas Alley
were strongly held by the enemy’s snipers, and
that he could call for artillery support if he
thought it advisable. He decided that it would
be useless to send out patrols at night, and determined
to find the other trench himself. This he
accomplished by going a long way round by the
sunken road, and on reaching the block in the
other trench he came across a small post with a
Lewis gun which had attracted a good deal of
attention from the Germans. Having located
the other trench he returned to Gas Alley and
organised a bombing party, which Lieutenant
J. F. J. Joicey-Cecil was to lead.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><abbr title="September">Sept.</abbr>
22-24.</p>

<p>Just as the attack was about to start next
morning the Germans hurled a succession of
bombs at the trench, but they exploded some
distance off and no one was hurt. Then the
Grenadier party broke down the block and
advanced, but discovered that the Germans had
retired 100 yards towards their main line, where
another block had been made by filling in the
trench for 40 yards. Captain Spencer-Churchill
<!--155.png--><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137"></a><span class="pageno">137</span>
followed on and established a bombing post there.
On returning to the sunken road, he received
orders to take over Gas Alley and the 80 yards
of the trench leading into it.</p>

<p>Being told by the guide that it was quite safe
to go over the top, he did so, with Sergeant
Roberts and his runner, Private Woolridge, but
hardly had they emerged when they found themselves
in full view of the enemy, who fired at them
from all directions. One bullet passed through
Captain Spencer-Churchill’s steel helmet, scratching
his face and knocking a piece of the helmet
into his eye, while another grazed Sergeant
Roberts’s ear. It was obvious, therefore, that any
attempt to connect the two trenches would have
to be made below the surface; as a preliminary,
two long sticks with an empty sand-bag on top
were put up in the farther trench, and proved to
be easily visible from Gas Alley. In the meantime
Lieutenant the <abbr title="Honorable">Hon.</abbr> E. W. Tennant, who
had been left in Gas Alley, had occupied his time
shooting at the enemy. Apparently there was
some movement by the Germans which led him
to shoot with his revolver, and a moment later
he fell dead, shot through the head by one of
the enemy’s snipers. The men of <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 4 Company
now set to work to connect the two trenches,
and managed to complete the work, though in the
gathering dusk they had at first some difficulty
in hitting off the exact spot.</p>

<p>That night the 4th Battalion was relieved by
the 1st Battalion Welsh Guards and retired to
Bernafay Wood. Captain Spencer-Churchill’s eyes
were now giving him great trouble, and his sight
<!--156.png--><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138"></a><span class="pageno">138</span>
became so much affected that he had to be led
by his orderly. At Bernafay Wood the surgeon
insisted on giving him a tetanus injection and
sending him down to hospital. The command
of the Company therefore devolved on Second
Lieutenant D. O. Constable. During the next two
nights the 4th Battalion was again engaged in
digging communication and assembly trenches,
and had some casualties. On the 24th the orders
for next day’s attack were issued, and at night
the 4th Battalion took up its position in the line.</p>

<p>The officers of the 4th Battalion who took part
in the attack of the 25th were:</p>

<p>The attack on the 25th, with the subsequent
capture of Lesbœufs, formed one of the most successful
operations in which the Guards Division
was engaged in the war. The preparation seems
to have been complete, and every possible contingency
foreseen. In the first attack on the
15th the 4th Grenadiers had been in reserve, and
so had not seen so much of the fighting as the
other battalions in the Division, but it was now
to take a leading part, and to go through some of
the toughest fighting of the whole battle of the
Somme. Orders were given for the attack to be
carried out by Pereira’s Brigade on the right and
Corkran’s on the left, while Ponsonby’s Brigade
remained in reserve. In Corkran’s Brigade, the
2nd Battalion Scots Guards were to take the right
and the 4th Battalion Grenadiers the left.</p>

<p>When the 4th Grenadiers moved up on the
night of the 24th, <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 4 Company under Second
Lieutenant Constable on the right and <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 2
Company under Captain Britten were sent to the
support trenches in front of Ginchy, while <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 1
Company under Captain Goschen and <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 3
under Captain Stewart remained in Trônes Wood.
On the left of the Grenadiers was a battalion of
the King’s Own Yorkshire Light Infantry, but
it was to start from a line quite 100 yards in
front of the assembly trench occupied by <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 2
Company, which made communication difficult.
Captain Britten, realising that it was essential to
keep touch with the battalion on the left, made
his men deepen a shallow communication trench
which ran in that direction. For the last five
nights the 4th Grenadiers had been constantly
employed in digging, and had been obliged to get
what sleep they could during the day&mdash;not at all
the same thing as a good night’s rest.</p>

<p>From 10 to 12 noon the artillery bombardment
continued, and was supplemented by the Stokes
mortars in the support trenches. During these preliminaries
Second Lieutenant Maine was wounded
<!--160.png--><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140"></a><span class="pageno">140</span>
in the foot, and sent down to the dressing station.
As zero time approached the men fixed bayonets
and remained motionless, waiting for the whistle
which was to be the signal to advance. The
officers in each company had carefully explained
to the platoon and section commanders exactly
what was expected of them, and each non-commissioned
officer therefore knew as much as
the captain.</p>

<p>At 12.35 <span class="sc small">P.M.</span> the line advanced, preceded by a
creeping barrage, which moved 150 yards ahead
at the rate of 50 yards per minute. In perfect
order, with not a man out of his place, the line
swept on until it came to the two intermediate
lines, which the officers had been warned to
expect somewhere in front of the first objective.
These had only recently been discovered, and no
one quite knew how strongly they were held.
Although the leading companies closed up as
near as they could to the creeping barrage, they
were met by a terrific machine-gun and rifle fire
from the intermediate lines, and terrible gaps
were made in the ranks. But the companies
pressed on, and made short work of the Germans
in these lines. Over 150 were killed there with
the bayonet. Re-forming again, the Grenadiers
rushed the first objective, which, to their surprise,
offered comparatively little resistance. Our guns,
however, had dealt effectively with the first objective,
and forced the occupants into dug-outs,
whereas the intermediate lines had only been passed
over by the creeping barrage. On the right the
Scots Guards met with little opposition, and easily
secured their first objective with no serious loss.</p>

<p><!--161.png--><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141"></a><span class="pageno">141</span>
An hour later, at 1.35 <span class="sc small">P.M.</span>, the attack on the
second objective started, and the 4th Battalion
Grenadiers moved forward, preceded as before
by a creeping barrage. Although there was some
stiff fighting at the end, the second objective
was secured up to time. The brigade on the
left had been held up, and the usual difficulty
arose of one brigade pressing on while another
was kept back. The right of the 4th Battalion
under Sergeant Pitt had managed without difficulty
to keep touch with the Scots Guards and
had reached the second objective, but on the
left, which was in the air, Second Lieutenant
Keith was unable to advance while he had the
Germans on the left in the same trench as his
Company. In fact, the situation on the left had
resolved itself into a bombing fight, and while
the right got forward the left had always to form
a defensive flank.</p>

<p>At 2.35 <span class="sc small">P.M.</span> the 1st Battalion Grenadiers passed
through the leading battalions and attacked the
third objective; but, as the left flank was still
exposed, the result was the same&mdash;the right got
well forward while the left écheloned back and
dug in. To fill the gaps the Welsh Guards were
sent up, and thus a continuous line, nearly 1400
yards long, was made, protecting the left flank
of the Division. That night the position was as
follows: the 1st Grenadiers on the right in the
third objective, facing east; the 2nd Battalion
Scots Guards in the centre, facing east and
north-east; the 1st Battalion Welsh Guards
and 4th Battalion Grenadiers on the left, facing
north. The 1st Battalion Grenadiers were in
<!--162.png--><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142"></a><span class="pageno">142</span>
touch with the 1st Guards Brigade on the northern
outskirts of Lesbœufs, and although the enemy
made counter-attacks in several places, the situation
remained unchanged during the night. In
spite of their heavy fighting, the men were in
very good spirits and made a hearty meal off
the German rations which they found, ending
up with German cigars. Water was the difficulty
at first, but parties soon came up with this,
as well as food and ammunition. The only company
officers now left with the Battalion were
Lieutenant Farquhar, Second Lieutenant Keith,
and Second Lieutenant J. W. F. Selby-Lowndes,
and the untiring energy they displayed elicited
the highest praise from the Commanding Officer.</p>

<p>A tank made its appearance at 6 <span class="sc small">A.M.</span>, and
slowly crawled along on the left of the Division
towards the Gird trench, where the brigade on
the left had been checked. This trench was
very strongly held by the enemy, but when the
tank arrived and fired into it 300 Germans
surrendered, and the Durham Light Infantry
moved up and took possession of it. The
Leicester Regiment continued the line to the left
towards Gueudecourt. At noon a large number
of Germans were seen to leave their trenches
between Gueudecourt and Le Transloy and retire
across the open in great disorder, dropping their
rifles and equipment as they went. Frantic
messages were sent back by telephone to our
artillery, which opened fire on them and inflicted
heavy losses.</p>

<p>A squadron of our cavalry rode up towards
Gueudecourt, and a cavalry patrol from the
<!--163.png--><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143"></a><span class="pageno">143</span>
5th Lancers went towards Lesbœufs, but Lord
Cavan decided that the situation did not permit
of cavalry going through, and they retired.
Between 8 <span class="sc small">A.M.</span> and noon the enemy ceased shelling,
but between 12 noon and 2 <span class="sc small">P.M.</span> a barrage
was sent over by the enemy’s artillery on our
two front support lines. Subsequently this died
down, and the evening was comparatively quiet.
Throughout the day the companies in the front
line suffered a good deal from small parties of
snipers concealed in shell-holes, but the patrols
eventually cleared the ground. At 10 <span class="sc small">P.M.</span>
the 4th Battalion was relieved by the 2nd
Guards Brigade, and went into bivouacs at
Carnoy.</p>

<p>From the 18th to the 26th the casualties in
the 4th Battalion were 445, exclusive of officers.
Among the officers Captain C. G. Goschen, Captain
W. A. L. Stewart, Lieutenant the <abbr title="Honorable">Hon.</abbr> E. W.
Tennant, Lieutenant J. F. J. Joicey-Cecil, Second
Lieutenant D. O. Constable, Second Lieutenant
M. H. F. Payne-Gallwey, and Second Lieutenant
A. C. Flower were killed, and Captain E. G.
Spencer-Churchill, Captain C. R. Britten, Second
Lieutenant A. R. Ellice, and Lieutenant H. C. S.
Maine were wounded. Second Lieutenant A. R.
Ellice died of wounds three days later.</p>

<p class="blockquote">On the 15th September especially, the vigorous

attacks of the Guards, in circumstances of great difficulty,

feasible operation.</p>

<p class="blockquote">On the 25th September, the attack of the hostile

gratitude for their fine performance.</p>

<p class="p2 unindent"><span class="sc">The</span> battle of the Somme continued, and further
gains by both the British and French armies
were announced. On November 13 a successful
offensive operation was carried out by the British
Army on the Ancre.</p>

<p>The French were still engaged in fighting at
Verdun, and eventually succeeded in regaining
all the ground they had lost in that part of
the line.</p>

<p>The Germans now developed a strong offensive
movement against the Roumanians, who, finding
themselves outnumbered and out-manœuvred,
retired into their own country.</p>

<p>The situation in Greece became very acute,
because King Constantine, in direct opposition
to the wishes of his people, made persistent
overtures to the Germans. The Allies, on the
invitation of the Greeks themselves, landed men
and blockaded the Greek coast. M. Venizelos
was brought back, and acclaimed by the people.</p>

<p>On the 22nd of November the Emperor
Francis Joseph of Austria died.</p>

<p class="p1">The 1st Battalion remained in bivouacs at
Carnoy after the battle of the Somme, and on
October 1 proceeded in motor buses, provided
by the French, to Fontaine-le-Sec, where it
remained till the end of the month. Training
was carried out daily with bombing practice
and occasional musketry. The following officers
joined during the month: on the 5th, Second
Lieutenant C. Wilkinson; on the 7th, Second
Lieutenant B. L. Lawrence; on the 18th, Lieutenant
F. C. <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Aubyn and Second Lieutenant
T. P. M. Bevan; on the 19th, Second Lieutenant
R. C. Cain.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><abbr title="November">Nov.</abbr></p>

<p>On November 1 Field-Marshal His Royal
Highness the Duke of Connaught, Colonel of the
Grenadier Guards, accompanied by Colonel Sir
Henry Streatfeild, the <abbr title="Lieutenant">Lieut.</abbr>-Colonel, inspected
the Guards Division. His Royal Highness was
received with a royal salute, and having ridden
down the ranks returned to the saluting base,
when the three Brigades marched past.</p>

<p>To relieve the monotony of the training, as
well as to be prepared for any eventuality, the
Battalions were now trained in open warfare.
On the 10th the 1st Battalion moved in French
motor buses to the sandpits at Méaulte, where it
remained five days. After spending forty-eight
hours at D Camp in Trônes Wood, it went into
the front trenches east of Gueudecourt, with the
Australian Division on the left and the 1st Guards
Brigade on the right. The Battalion spent three
uneventful days in the trenches, except that
<!--170.png--><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150"></a><span class="pageno">150</span>
while it was being relieved by the 59th Australian
Infantry, Lieutenant V. C. H. Gordon-Lennox
was wounded. On the 20th the Battalion proceeded
to Montauban, moving on the following
day to Méaulte. On the 2nd Captain C. V.
Fisher-Rowe joined the Battalion, and on the
13th Lieutenant W. J. Dashwood arrived.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><abbr title="December">Dec.</abbr></p>

<p>After a fortnight at Méaulte the Battalion
went into dug-outs in Bouleaux Wood on
December 6, and two days later relieved the
4th Battalion in the trenches. On the 11th it
retired to Maltzhorn Camp, moving on the
following day to Bronfay, and then back to
Bouleaux Wood. This routine was followed up
to the end of the month, the Battalion spending
three days in the trenches followed by a week
at Maltzhorn, Bronfay, and Bouleaux, but nothing
of importance happened. On the 17th Captain
P. J. S. Pearson-Gregory joined, and during the
month several drafts arrived to bring the Battalion
up to strength.</p>

<p class="p1">After spending the end of September at
Morlancourt, the 2nd Battalion proceeded in
buses lent by the French Government to Aumont,
where it remained for six weeks. The time was
spent in training and musketry, with instruction
in bombing and Lewis gunnery. The following
officers joined during the month: Second Lieutenant
W. H. S. Dent on the 2nd; Captain E. O.
Stewart on the 5th; Lieutenant the <abbr title="Honorable">Hon.</abbr> F. H.
Manners and Lieutenant F. A. M. Browning,
Second Lieutenant R. A. W. Bicknell and Second

Lieutenant A. H. Penn, and Second Lieutenant
Lord Basil Blackwood on the 16th. On the 10th
Captain the <abbr title="Honorable">Hon.</abbr> W. R. Bailey, <abbr title="Distinguished Service Order">D.S.O.</abbr>, was
granted the temporary rank of Major, and became
Second in Command of the Battalion, his place
as Adjutant being taken by Lieutenant A. H.
Penn.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><abbr title="November">Nov.</abbr></p>

<p>On November 6 Captain I. Rose was transferred
to the 3rd Battalion. On the 10th the
2nd Battalion proceeded in French motor buses
<i>via</i> Méaulte to the Citadel Camp, where it remained
for two days, after which it marched to
“H.I.” Camp near Montauban. The weather
was very bad, and the whole country was a sea
of mud, which made marching across country
anything but easy. On the 15th the Battalion
proceeded to Camps A and B at Trônes Wood,
and moved up the following day into the line,
relieving the 1st Battalion Irish Guards in the
inside right sector between Lesbœufs and Gueudecourt,
where the front line consisted of shell-holes
joined up, and was held by a succession
of small posts. Owing to the frosty condition
of the ground, the relief was carried out quickly
and without casualties, but a working platoon
that had been sent on ahead had two men killed,
and Lieutenant J. D. Wilton, the officer in
charge, and two men wounded. The line was
<!--174.png--><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152"></a><span class="pageno">152</span>
not good, and as there were no communication
trenches considerable difficulty was experienced
in bringing up the rations and trench requirements.
The second day in the trenches was one
of the most trying the Battalion had experienced,
as the snow changed to rain, and a thaw began
which converted the whole ground to a morass.
No one who has not experienced the difficulties
of moving about up to the knee in liquid
mud can realise the great fatigue it entails:
many men were completely exhausted, while
some lost their way owing to the tracks having
been obliterated. All the time the shelling continued,
causing a certain amount of casualties.
On the 19th, after a long and difficult relief, the
Battalion returned to H.I. Camp, where hot food
and warm water for the feet were provided.
During the relief Captain C. N. Newton was
slightly wounded, but remained at duty. On
the 21st the Battalion marched to Méaulte,
where it remained until the end of the month.
However, it took some days to clean the clothes,
rifles, and equipment which were plastered with
mud, and training was not commenced until the
23rd. Every day a certain number of men were
detailed for work on improving the roads, each
company taking it in turns to supply the necessary
fatigue parties.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><abbr title="December">Dec.</abbr></p>

<p>On December 2 the 2nd Battalion marched
<i>via</i> Bray to Camp 108 at Bronfay, and later
moved to Maltzhorn Camp. On the 9th it
relieved the 1st Battalion Irish Guards in the
trenches at Sailly-Saillisel, where again, owing
to the mud, it had a very fatiguing three
<!--175.png--><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153"></a><span class="pageno">153</span>
days, and suffered several casualties. On the
11th it was relieved by the 2nd Battalion
Irish Guards, and marched to Maltzhorn Camp.
The following day it went to Montauban, and
after two days’ rest moved up to the front line
at Combles, where the trenches were still in a
bad state owing to the wet weather. For three
days it remained in the line, and the men worked
very hard on improving the trenches and making
a foundation of timber and rubble. When it
was relieved, <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 4 Company was heavily shelled
and suffered a number of casualties. On the
18th the Battalion marched to Trônes Wood,
where it entrained for Plateau Siding. On the
20th it returned to Combles, where there was
little hostile fire, but the sodden condition of the
ground made all work very difficult. After three
days in the trenches it moved back to Plateau
Siding, and subsequently marched to Camp 15.
Divine service was held there on Christmas Day,
but as the Battalion had to return to the trenches
the following day, the Christmas dinners were
postponed until later. Three uneventful days
were spent in the trenches at Combles, and on the
30th they went back once more to Camp 15.
On the 12th Lieutenant J. N. Buchanan joined
the Battalion. Brigadier-General C. E. Pereira,
<abbr title="Companion Order of Saint George">C.M.G.</abbr>, <abbr title="Distinguished Service Order">D.S.O.</abbr>, was promoted and given command
of a Division. He was succeeded by Brigadier-General
G. D. Jeffreys, who had fought in every
engagement since August 1914, and who had
latterly commanded the 2nd Battalion Grenadiers
with conspicuous ability.</p>

<p class="p1">After the battle of the Somme the 3rd
Battalion moved from Carnoy to Heucourt by
train, and remained there till the end of October.
Training was carried out in accordance with the
new training schemes, and there were field days
in which Advance-guards, Flank-guards, and
tactical schemes were practised.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><abbr title="November">Nov.</abbr></p>

<p>On November 1 Field-Marshal His Royal
Highness the Duke of Connaught, accompanied
by Colonel Sir H. Streatfeild, inspected the
Guards Division. On the 6th Captain I. <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> C.
Rose joined the Battalion. On the 11th, after
a journey in French motor lorries, the Battalion
arrived at Méaulte, where it remained until the
15th, and then moved to Mansell Camp near
Carnoy. There the men were employed in mending
the roads until the 27th, when the Battalion
marched to the Camp at L’Arbre Fourchée just
north of Bray.</p>

<p>From this time onward the Division was
divided into two groups, each consisting of six
battalions. This necessitated the 2nd Guards
Brigade being split up, and two battalions were
sent to each group. The right group consisted
of the 1st Guards Brigade with the 1st Battalion
Coldstream and 2nd Battalion Irish Guards.
The left group consisted of the 3rd Guards
Brigade with the 3rd Battalion Grenadier Guards
and 1st Battalion Scots Guards.</p>

<p>Thus the brigade system was in abeyance, and
battalions worked the line in a regular cycle, always
going and returning to the same camp or portion
<!--177.png--><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155"></a><span class="pageno">155</span>
of the line. All blankets and cookers were made
camp stores, to reduce the work of the transport.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><abbr title="December">Dec.</abbr></p>

<p>On December 1 the 3rd Battalion moved to
a camp at Maltzhorn Farm, and on the following
day marched <i>via</i> Trônes Wood, Guillemont,
and Combles to Haie Wood, where it was taken
by French guides into the front line of trenches
north of Sailly-Saillisel and south of Morval.
This portion of the line had been only recently
captured by the French, who had not had
time to organise it properly. The parapets
were extremely thin, and there were few if
any fire-steps, while communication with the
front was entirely overground. There was not
a single strand of wire on the frontage, and the
enemy was hardly eighty yards away. While
the relief was being carried out, forty to fifty
Germans attempted to make a raid, and got
right up to the parapet, where they shot a French
machine-gunner who was sitting on the saddle
of his gun. The remainder of the gun-team
retreated hastily down a small communication
trench, and met <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 4 Company coming up.
Rapid fire was at once opened on the raiders,
who disappeared carrying off the machine-gun
with them, and any further development of the
attack was successfully frustrated, although the
German barrage on our front line continued for
some time. The following day a patrol that
went out found the bodies of seven Germans
belonging to a storm section of the 23rd Grenadier
Regiment of German Infantry, and close by the
machine-gun that had been lost. This gun was
subsequently returned undamaged to the French.</p>

<p><!--178.png--><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156"></a><span class="pageno">156</span>
The rest of the time in the trenches passed
without incident, but a great deal of work was
done in thickening the parapet and making
fire-steps. On the 5th the 3rd Battalion was
relieved and marched to Maltzhorn Farm. The
following days were spent in going by train to
Bronfay Farm and then on to Bouleaux Wood.
On the 11th the Battalion returned to the
trenches, which it found in a deplorable condition,
the parapet having fallen in along the greater
part of the frontage. Most of the men had to
stand with the mud above the knee, and in some
places above the waist; some had to be dug out
on the way up. Nor did matters improve, as the
weather conditions became still worse and rain
and snow came down intermittently. So bad
were the trenches that it was decided to hold the
front line in islands, and to concentrate the work
on them. The three days spent in the trenches
were some of the most unpleasant the men had
ever had, and when they were relieved they
were in a most exhausted condition, being
encased in mud and quite wet through. After
four days’ rest, when all the arms and equipment
were overhauled, the Battalion returned to the
front line for forty-eight hours, but the trenches
had already been very much improved. Two
days in and two days out of the trenches became
the routine till the end of the month, and by
degrees the “islands” were made habitable. There
had been casualties almost every day in addition
to cases of trench feet and chills, but with the
trenches in such a state this was inevitable.</p>

<p class="p1">The 4th Battalion was sadly depleted after
the battle of the Somme, having lost nearly half
its number, and a reorganisation and redistribution
of the officers and non-commissioned officers
was therefore necessary. On the 28th September
Major-General Feilding addressed the men on
parade, and paid a great tribute to their share in
the battle. On the 30th the 4th Battalion moved
to the sandpits at Méaulte, and the next day
<span class="sidenote"><abbr title="October">Oct.</abbr></span>
to Morlancourt, where it got into motor buses
belonging to the French, and proceeded <i>via</i> Amiens
to Epaumesnil. There it remained for five weeks;
the billets were good, the weather on the whole
was fine, and the Battalion was able gradually
to recover its spirits and normal proportions.
Company training was carried out in addition to
musketry practice on the rifle-range and Lewis-gun
instruction. On the 4th Brigadier-General
C. E. Corkran, commanding the 3rd Guards
Brigade, addressed the Battalion on parade, and
said that their splendid behaviour during the
recent fighting could not have been surpassed.
He thought that the part played by the Battalion
in the battle of the Somme equalled in brilliance
what it had achieved in any of the battles
whose names were embroidered on the Regimental
Colours.</p>

<p>The following officers joined the Battalion
during the month: on the 2nd, Captain the
<abbr title="Honorable">Hon.</abbr> F. E. Needham; on the 4th, Captain E. G.
Spencer-Churchill; on the 5th, Captain E. O.
Stewart and Lieutenant R. Farquhar; on the 6th,

<p>On November 1 Field-Marshal His Royal
Highness the Duke of Connaught, accompanied
by Colonel Sir Henry Streatfeild, inspected the
Guards Division. On the 10th the Battalion
left Epaumesnil, and was transported in French
motor buses <i>via</i> Amiens to the sandpits at
Méaulte. Two days later it moved to Carnoy,
and on the 13th went up into the trenches in
front of Lesbœufs and Gueudecourt, with two
companies in the front line, one in support and
one in reserve. The front line was much battered,
and was also 3 feet deep in mud, which made the
relief a matter of some difficulty. In addition
to the continual sniping there was considerable
activity on the part of the enemy’s artillery,
which resulted in a considerable number of
casualties. The weather had now turned very
cold, and it was freezing, with snow and rain
at intervals. On the 17th the 4th Battalion
retired to H Camp at Carnoy, where it remained
until the end of the month. On the 19th
<abbr title="Lieutenant">Lieut.</abbr>-Colonel Lord Henry Seymour left to take
temporary command of the 2nd Brigade.</p>

<p>On December 5 the 4th Battalion took over
a line of trenches near Sailly-Saillisel, and two
companies of the 2nd Battalion Scots Guards
were attached. The front line was a long one,
and there were no communication trenches,
which made the relief more dangerous than usual.
After four days, during which there was little
shelling, the Battalion retired to Bouleaux Wood,
and the next day proceeded to Bronfay Farm.
On the 9th <abbr title="Lieutenant">Lieut.</abbr>-Colonel G. C. Hamilton arrived
and took over command, and on the 14th the
Battalion returned to the front line. During
this relief the Germans put down a barrage, and
Lieutenant H. J. Boyton was killed by a shell
and a few men wounded. After the first day the
shelling diminished considerably, and there were
no more casualties, but the mud was as bad as
ever. Private James behaved with the greatest
gallantry the first night, and went over to bring
in three men who were wounded within fifty
yards of the enemy. There were again a certain
number of casualties, and Lieutenant J. W. F.
Selby-Lowndes was wounded. Returning to
the line again on the 27th, the Battalion had a
quiet time, and suffered no casualties.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Diary of the War</i></p>

<p class="p1 sidenote">1917.</p>

<p class="p2 unindent"><span class="sc">At</span> the beginning of 1917 events of the highest
importance succeeded each other with startling
rapidity. On the British front a series of operations
was commenced on the Ancre, beginning at
Sailly-Saillisel Ridge; and so successful was the
British offensive that village after village was
captured. The Germans adroitly retired to what
was known as the Hindenburg line, and after
Bapaume and Peronne had been captured Sir
Douglas Haig pressed forward towards Cambrai
on a 100-miles front. The French had some very
stiff fighting between the Aisne and the Argonne,
and also between Tahure and Massiges where
the Germans broke through. There was still
fighting round Verdun, and the Germans claimed
some successes there; but, on the other hand, in
conjunction with the British, the French made
an advance between La Fère and <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Quentin.</p>

<p>In Russia some progress had been made in the
Bukovina and also near Riga, when a revolution
broke out in Petrograd. The Czar was forced
to abdicate, and Kerensky proclaimed a Russian
Republic. Under the delusion that this change
<!--185.png--><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161"></a><span class="pageno">161</span>
would assist either Russia or the Allied cause,
the British Government sent messages of congratulation.
In Roumania the situation was hopeless,
and the Germans were masters of Wallachia.
The Greek Government accepted all the Allies’
demands, and even sent apologies; and when the
junction of the French and the Italians in South
Albania isolated Greece from the Central Powers,
the activities of King Constantine in the German
cause were much lessened.</p>

<p>On January 31 the policy of unrestricted
naval warfare was adopted by the Germans, who
announced their intention of sinking every ship
neutral or otherwise. With Russia in a state
of revolution, the Germans calculated that they
would be able to dispose of the other Allies
before the United States Army was ready. This
was a plausible theory, since with the tightening
up of the submarine blockade there was some
prospect of Great Britain being starved into
submission before America could move. On
February 3 the United States broke off diplomatic
relations with the Central Powers and
declared war.</p>

<p>In Mesopotamia General Sir Stanley Maude
commenced a series of brilliant operations which
resulted in the fall of Kut-el-Amara on February
24, and the capture of Baghdad on March 11.
In Palestine General Sir A. Murray succeeded in
inflicting a blow on the Turks at Gaza, and took
900 prisoners, but these operations were only
partially successful.</p>

<p>On March 13 China broke off diplomatic
relations with Germany.</p>

<p>At the beginning of 1917 the 1st Battalion was
in camp at Maltzhorn, where it had retired after
the usual tour of duty in the trenches. On the
2nd it moved to Méaulte, and on the 10th to
Billon Wood Camp, where it remained for twelve
days’ training by companies. On the 22nd it
proceeded to Priez Farm, and on the 25th to
Maurepas. Lieutenant C. S. de Cerjat joined on
the 14th, and Lieutenant C. D. Baker on the 24th.</p>

<p>On the 30th the 1st Battalion moved into
<!--187.png--><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163"></a><span class="pageno">163</span>
the line about fifteen miles north of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Quentin,
and during the first three days spent in the
trenches nothing occurred worth recording. Just
before it was relieved, however, the Germans
attempted a raid on the advanced posts. An
intense bombardment lasting for thirty-five
minutes warned the 1st Battalion of the impending
attack, and the King’s Company, which
was holding the part of the line selected by the
Germans, was easily able to repulse the raiders
by rifle-fire. The casualties were 1 man killed,
1 missing, and 2 wounded. In the evening the
1st Battalion was relieved by the 4th Battalion,
and proceeded to camp at Maurepas.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><abbr title="February">Feb.</abbr></p>

<p>After four days’ rest it returned to the trenches,
placing two companies in the front line and two
companies in reserve, and carrying out inter-company
relief. On the 10th of February, about
5 <span class="sc small">A.M.</span>, the enemy launched a bombing attack,
and tried to raid the two right posts of the right
companies, but it was a half-hearted affair, and
the enemy succeeded in reaching the wire in
front of our trenches; the Lewis-gun and rifle
fire was too strong for them, and none of the
bombs they threw reached our men. The
remainder of the month was spent at Mericourt,
where training was carried on by companies.
Second Lieutenant S. Y. P. Gardner and Second
Lieutenant O. F. Stein arrived on the 13th, and
on the 21st Lieutenant M. Thrupp joined the
Battalion. On the 17th a Guard of Honour consisting
of Captain L. G. Fisher-Rowe, Lieutenant
W. J. Dashwood, and Lieutenant C. Wilkinson,
with 100 rank and file from the King’s Company,
<!--188.png--><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164"></a><span class="pageno">164</span>
proceeded to the 4th Army Headquarters for
the reception of General Nivelle, the Commander-in-Chief
of the French Armies.</p>

<p class="sidenote">March.</p>

<p>On March 3 the 1st Battalion moved to
Bronfay Farm, and on the following day to the
trenches at Fregicourt and Haie Wood, where
it was employed in improving the dug-outs.
On the 5th a shell most unluckily fell among
the King’s Company. Company Sergeant-Major
Bradbury had both his legs blown off, and three
other Sergeants were wounded. Captain Fisher-Rowe
was knocked down but not hurt, and
Brigadier-General Lord Henry Seymour and
<abbr title="Lieutenant">Lieut.</abbr>-Colonel Maitland, who were only a few yards
off, were untouched. Sergeant-Major Bradbury
was carried back on a stretcher, but it was plain
to every one, including himself, that he could
not live. As he was being borne away he asked
to speak to the Adjutant, Captain Pearson-Gregory,
who at once came up thinking it was
some personal request or last wish the dying
man wanted to communicate. “You won’t forget,
sir,” said Bradbury, “the Battalion has to
find a fatigue party of a hundred men to-morrow
early.” Unselfish to the last, no thought of
himself in his terrible condition crossed his mind.
His sole idea, to the very last, was to do his duty
to the Battalion.</p>

<p>Another four days in the trenches caused
further casualties, and Lieutenant H. B. Vernon
was wounded. On the 11th the 1st Battalion
retired to Bronfay Farm, where it remained resting
for a week, after which it returned to the front
line. The Germans were now retiring along the
<!--189.png--><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165"></a><span class="pageno">165</span>
whole front, and a close and unremitting pursuit
had to be maintained. The 1st Battalion
was employed on outpost duty with orders to
accelerate the retirement as much as possible.
This necessitated constant advances, but each
line, as it was reached, had to be consolidated in
case of counter-attack. After four days of this
the Battalion retired to Maurepas, and subsequently
to Camp 15 at Billon. Second Lieutenant
R. B. <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Q. Wall joined on the 8th of
March, Lieutenant P. G. Simmons on the 14th,
Lieutenant R. H. Rolfe and Second Lieutenant
R. F. W. Echlin on the 30th.</p>

<p>From January 2 to 25 the 2nd Battalion
remained at Méaulte, training by companies,
providing fatigue parties, and receiving instruction
in bombing, Lewis gunnery, and precautions
against gas attacks. Each company went
through a course of musketry, and constantly
had route marches. On the 25th orders were
received to move to Priez Farm in motor buses and
lorries, but owing to some unexplained mistake
only seven buses and nine lorries arrived, so that
a large part of the Battalion had to march.
Priez Farm, which is between Combles and
Rancourt, consisted of dug-outs which were constantly
subjected to the enemy’s shells. The men
were employed in filling sand-bags, but owing to
a sharp frost the ground was hard as iron, and
it was by no means easy to obtain the requisite
soil. One shell pitched among the cookers, killing
2 men and wounding 4, while another fell on the
water-cart, wounding 2 men. On the 29th the
Battalion was relieved by the 3rd Battalion
Coldstream and marched to Billon Camp near
Maricourt. The weather was bitterly cold, and
the men suffered a good deal in spite of the
warm clothing provided for them.</p>

<p><!--191.png--><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167"></a><span class="pageno">167</span>
The following officers joined during the month:
on the 2nd, Lieutenant J. C. Cornforth; on the
14th, Lieutenant K. O’G. Harvard; on the 24th,
Captain G. C. FitzH. Harcourt-Vernon, <abbr title="Distinguished Service Order">D.S.O.</abbr></p>

<p class="sidenote"><abbr title="February">Feb.</abbr></p>

<p>For the first ten days in February the 2nd
Battalion remained at Billon Camp, where the
companies trained. A sporting event somewhat
out of the ordinary was held on the 6th, 7th,
and 8th, when Lord Cavan started a ratting
competition, and promised an extra ration of
rum to the Battalion that succeeded in killing
the largest number of rats. The 2nd Battalion,
accustomed to excel in all forms of sport, succeeded
in securing this coveted prize by capturing
as many as 386 rats. On the 10th the Battalion
marched to Maurepas Ravine, and two days
later took over from the 1st Battalion the trenches
between Peronne and <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Pierre Vaast Wood.
This part of the line consisted of a series of
isolated posts, which were dry and well revetted,
on the forward slope of the hill. The Battalion
remained in the trenches five days, and although
there was a good deal of shelling there were
fortunately no casualties. On the 15th it was
relieved by the 1st Battalion Irish Guards, and
returned to camp at Maurepas. The weather
was now warmer, and a thaw which had set in
made the whole camp very muddy. After four
days’ rest the Battalion returned to the trenches
and again carried out inter-Company reliefs.
On the 21st Lieutenant A. McW. Lawson-Johnston
and Lieutenant R. Terrell were wounded
by the same shell: the latter recovered, but
Lieutenant Lawson-Johnston, who was hit in
<!--192.png--><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168"></a><span class="pageno">168</span>
twenty places, died from his wounds the following
day. There were no casualties among other
ranks. The mornings were very foggy, and
<abbr title="Lieutenant">Lieut.</abbr>-Colonel de Crespigny took advantage of this
fact to reconnoitre the ground to his immediate
front. On the 23rd the Battalion, after being
relieved by the 21st Battalion of the Middlesex
Regiment, returned to Maurepas, and on the 26th
proceeded to Camp 107 at Billon, remaining there
until March 14.</p>

<p class="sidenote">March.</p>

<p>The German retirement necessitated by the
battle of the Somme had now begun, but it was
impossible to tell at first what exactly the enemy’s
intentions were. After four days at Maurepas
the Battalion moved up into the line at Sailly-Saillisel,
where no German could be seen and no
gun heard. The outpost line had been advanced
to within 1000 yards of Le Mesnil, and cavalry
patrols were being pushed forward to establish
touch with the enemy. The difficulty presented
itself of how to make the guns and supplies
keep pace with the advance, and all available
battalions were employed in road-making.</p>

<p>One curious incident happened during this
advance. Two Russian soldiers who had remained
hidden after the German retirement were found
in Etricourt. Originally taken prisoner on the
Russian frontier, they had been transferred to the
Western front, and employed in digging. Hearing
the orders given by the German officers to retire,
they managed to conceal themselves, and waited
until the British troops arrived. They were overjoyed
at finding themselves once more free, and
delighted at their cordial reception.</p>

<p><!--193.png--><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169"></a><span class="pageno">169</span>
The interesting duty of following up the
Germans did not fall to the 2nd Battalion,
which was employed till the end of the month
in making roads and filling up shell-holes.</p>

<p class="unindent">The 3rd Battalion came out of the trenches
on January 2, and spent the next ten days training
at Corbie, Billon Farm, and Priez Farm.
This was followed by three uneventful days in
the trenches from the 12th to the 15th, and
again from the 21st to the 24th, after which it
returned to Mericourt. On the 28th it marched
<!--194.png--><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170"></a><span class="pageno">170</span>
to La Briqueterie, where the men were employed
in making the foundation for the Decauville
railway, a tiring fatigue owing to the frozen
nature of the ground and the long distances to
be covered.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><abbr title="February">Feb.</abbr></p>

<p>During the greater part of February the
3rd Battalion remained at Mericourt training.
On the 7th it was chosen from the 2nd Guards
Brigade to drill at Ville before General MacMahon,
who expressed himself much pleased with the
smart appearance of the Battalion. The parade
was rendered more impressive by the presence
of the band of the regiment under Lieutenant
Williams. On the 9th an unfortunate bombing
accident occurred: a defective bomb of the
Mills Adapter type burst at the muzzle, and
wounded Lieutenant W. G. Orriss, Lance-Sergeant
Dugmore, and two men. Brigadier-General
Lord Henry Seymour and Major Rasch,
who was temporarily in command of the
Battalion, were looking on at the time, and
fortunately were not hit. On the 26th the 3rd
Battalion marched to Maurepas, and on the
following day went into the front line, where
it remained for five days, carrying out inter-Company
reliefs. On the last day the Fifteenth
Corps carried out an attack east of Bouchavesnes,
and the Battalion was to have assisted with a
discharge of smoke-bombs, but owing to an
unfavourable wind the orders were cancelled.
Several patrols were, however, sent out to ascertain
how strongly the enemy’s posts were held,
and the nature and strength of his wire.</p>

<p class="sidenote">March.</p>

<p>Early on the 5th the Battalion was relieved,
<!--195.png--><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171"></a><span class="pageno">171</span>
and retired for three days’ rest to Maurepas.
Three more uneventful days were spent in the
trenches from the 8th to the 11th, but the
retirement of the Germans had begun, and their
lines were therefore only thinly held. On the
15th two companies were ordered to move up
into the reserve trenches, while the rest of the
Battalion remained at Priez ready to move at a
moment’s notice. On the following day <abbr title="Lieutenant">Lieut.</abbr>-Colonel
A. Thorne took charge of the centre of
the whole line, while Major Rasch commanded
the Battalion, and Captain R. W. Parker took
command of the vanguard composed of two
companies. The advance began on the 16th,
and met with little resistance, the patrols pushing
forward through <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Pierre Vaast Wood to Vaux
Wood. On the 18th the Battalion was relieved,
and spent the rest of the month on fatigues and
work on the railway.</p>

<p>The first week in January was spent by the
4th Battalion at Mericourt, and on the 9th
Major-General Feilding presented medal ribbons
to the <abbr title="Non Commissioned Officer">N.C.O.</abbr>’s and men of the Battalion who had
been awarded the Military Medal. On the 10th
the Battalion proceeded to Billon Camp, where
it was employed in road-making and improving
the camp, and on the 14th it moved to Priez
Farm. The weather was now very cold, and there
was continual snow. Occasional shells reminded
the men forcibly of the presence of the enemy,
but there were no casualties. On the 18th the
Battalion retired to Billon Camp, remaining there
until the 25th, when it moved to Maurepas.
The following day it took over the trenches
immediately east of Rancourt on the edge of
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Pierre Vaast Wood. This part of the line
was held by a series of posts or islands, which
were duckboardcd; it was a quiet spot, and there
was practically no shelling.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><abbr title="February">Feb.</abbr></p>

<p>After four days’ rest the Battalion returned
to the line, and during the relief came in for a
heavy barrage, but after it had settled down, the
<!--197.png--><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173"></a><span class="pageno">173</span>
shelling died away. On February 7 it was
relieved, and retired to Maurepas. Two days
later it went by train to Méaulte, and marched
from there to Ville-sur-Ancre, where it remained
till the end of the month going through the usual
routine of training. The French War Minister,
General Lyautey, inspected the 3rd Guards
Brigade, and was reported to have been much
impressed by all he saw.</p>

<p class="sidenote">March.</p>

<p>On March 1 the Battalion moved to Bronfay,
and on the following day to Combles with two
companies at Haie Wood. There it went into
the trenches until the 6th. During this tour it
came in for a good deal of shelling, and Lieutenant
B. Burman and seventeen other ranks
were wounded. After four days’ rest at Fregicourt,
the Battalion returned to the same line
of trenches, but this time found everything far
quieter. On the 13th it moved to Billon Camp,
and on the 19th to Priez Farm, whence it moved
up to the trenches for four uneventful days.
On the 24th it retired to Bronfay Farm, and on
the 27th marched to Clery, where it was employed
on railway work.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Diary of the War</i></p>

<p class="p2 unindent"><span class="sc">The</span> British offensive operations still continued
with great success, and considerable progress
was made on the famous Vimy Ridge. An advance
on a 50-miles front was undertaken in the
direction of Cambrai, and 19,343 prisoners were
taken, in addition to 257 guns and 227 trench
mortars. The Germans made fierce counter-attacks,
but were not sufficiently strong to check
the advance, and even the Hindenburg switch
line was broken through. A further offensive
from Ypres to Armentières was commenced, and
there was some very stiff fighting on the Messines-Wytschaete
ridge. The French were equally
successful, and having gained positions between
Soissons and Craonne they pushed forward on a
100-miles front, taking 20,000 prisoners. In May
they succeeded in capturing Craonne, and the
important position on the Chemin des Dames.
During the Allied offensive 52,000 Germans were
taken prisoner, and 446 guns and 1000 machine-guns
fell into our hands.</p>

<p>The Italians made good progress on the slopes
<!--199.png--><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175"></a><span class="pageno">175</span>
of Monte Santo and on the heights of Gorizia, and
there was some fierce fighting on Monte Vodia.
Later San Giovanni was taken and the Timavo
crossed, when there was more fighting on the
Corso Plateau. In Russia the war was at a
standstill, although a certain amount of fighting
still continued in isolated places. In Greece
the situation was still so unsatisfactory that
the Allies agreed to let France undertake the
whole Greek question. M. Jonnart was accordingly
sent to Athens, where he at once demanded
the abdication of King Constantine. Two days
later King Constantine abdicated in favour of
his second son Alexander, who was proclaimed
King.</p>

<p>In Mesopotamia General Sir Stanley Maude
gained two victories over the retreating Turks
near Deltawa and Istabulat.</p>

<p>The following nations severed relations with
Germany and joined the Allies: Cuba, Brazil,
Bolivia, Liberia, and Honduras.</p>

<p>The whole of April was spent by the 1st
Battalion in working on the railway and in training.
Second Lieutenant A. S. Chambers joined
on the 11th; Lieutenant E. G. L. King, Second
Lieutenant H. G. Johnson, and Second Lieutenant
J. W. Chapple on the 30th. On the 26th Captain
C. V. Fisher-Rowe arrived to take up the duties
of Second in Command, but did not remain long,
as he was appointed a week later Brigade-Major
to the 51st Infantry Brigade.</p>

<p class="sidenote">May.</p>

<p>May was spent in very much the same way,
with three companies on railway fatigue and one
company training. The Commanding Officer,
<abbr title="Lieutenant">Lieut.</abbr>-Colonel Maitland, started competitions in
all the various arts of war, and there seems no
doubt that these competitions made the men keen
and fostered a spirit of friendly rivalry between
the various teams. There were also tactical
schemes in open warfare, so that if by any chance
the German line should break, the men would
<!--201.png--><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177"></a><span class="pageno">177</span>
know how to act. The latter part of the month
was devoted solely to training, and the Commanding
Officer was able to assemble the whole Battalion.
Captain Viscount Lascelles arrived on
the 2nd, and a few days later was promoted to
the rank of temporary Major, and appointed
Second in Command. Lieutenant G. F. Pauling,
M.C., joined on the 2nd. On the 31st the Battalion
went by train to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Omer, and subsequently
to Campagne.</p>

<p class="sidenote">June.</p>

<p>For the first fortnight in June it remained
training at Campagne, and then proceeded to
Zudausques. On the 18th it moved to Herzeele,
where it remained until July 13.</p>

<p>The 3rd Guards Brigade now moved up into
the line in order to take part in the attack by
the Guards Division on the 31st. The Battalion
Headquarters were at Boesinghe Château, and
all four companies had two platoons in the
front line. The two days spent in the trenches
were uncomfortable and noisy, but there were no
casualties. The Germans raided the 1st Battalion
Irish Guards which was on the right, and
the platoon on the right of the Grenadiers’ line
was involved, but Second Lieutenant Johnson,
who was in command, succeeded in preventing
the enemy reaching our lines.</p>

<p>On the 15th the 1st Battalion came out of
the line, and retired to de Wippe Cabaret,
where for ten days it was employed in carrying
up ammunition and war material to the front
line. This necessitated constant visits to the
front trenches always under shell-fire, and there
were in consequence many casualties. On the
22nd Lieutenant E. G. L. King was killed by
a shell close up to the front trench while in
command of a fatigue party. The loss of so
promising and keen an officer just before the
attack was most unfortunate for the Battalion.
On the 24th Second Lieutenant R. H. Rolfe,
who had only just rejoined from hospital, was
wounded in the same way. Second Lieutenant
<!--203.png--><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179"></a><span class="pageno">179</span>
L. de J. Harvard joined the Battalion on the

Forest Camp so as to be ready to take its place
in the line for the attack on the 31st.</p>

During the first week in April the 2nd Battalion
remained in camp at Ginchy, and was employed
in road-making. Later it moved to Rocquigny
for a week, and then on to Bronfay to train.
The monotony of company training was relieved
by brigade competitions, and <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 11 Platoon
under Lieutenant Gunnis succeeded not only in
winning the prize, but also in being first in every
event&mdash;a very remarkable performance.</p>

<p class="sidenote">May.</p>

<p>On May 9 the Battalion marched <i>via</i> Maricourt,
Guillemont, and Ginchy to a camp near
Lesbœufs, and three days later moved to Le
Mesnil, where it worked on the railway. On the
20th it returned to Bronfay, and on the way
halted for half-an-hour to enable the men to view
the memorial to officers and men of the Regiment
who had been killed there in September 1916.
It consisted of an oak cross about ten feet high,
made out of wood collected from the ruins of
Lesbœufs. On May 22 the Battalion went to
Sailly-le-Sec, where it remained till the end of
the month, when it went by train <i>via</i> Cassel
and Bavinchove to Renescure.</p>

<p class="sidenote">June.</p>

<p>During the first fortnight in June the 2nd
Battalion remained at Renescure training and
going through a course of musketry, and on the
16th marched to Winnezeele. The weather was
fine, and though the heat was great the men
stood the marching well. On the 18th the
Battalion marched into Belgium, and went into
bivouacs at Proven, where it remained for two
days and then moved to Herzeele. On the 20th
it attended a parade at which General Antoine,
commanding the First French Army, presented
<!--205.png--><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181"></a><span class="pageno">181</span>
crosses of the Legion of Honour and medals to
officers of the Fifth British Army. At the conclusion
of the parade the Battalion marched past
followed by the 2nd Battalion Coldstream Guards,
and then returned to billets. On the 24th it
marched to de Wippe Cross-roads, where it remained
a week. The enemy’s big guns carried
out some long-distance shelling, chiefly on the
roads at night, but fortunately the 2nd Battalion
suffered no casualties. On the 28th it marched
to Cardoen Farm.</p>

<p>On July 2 the 2nd Battalion relieved the 3rd
Battalion Coldstream Guards in the Boesinghe
Sector, which was soon to become the site selected
for an offensive. The Belgians at the time were
on the right, and were subsequently relieved by
the French. The trenches occupied by the Battalion
were extended for about 1500 yards along
the western bank of the Yser Canal. The first
day was spent in improving the position, and as
soon as it became dark the men were mostly
employed in carrying up material of all kinds to
the front area. At 11.30 <span class="sc small">P.M.</span> orders were received
from the Brigadier to make two raids into the
enemy’s lines, with a view to obtaining identification
of the German regiments employed there,
as well as information as to the whereabouts of
the German trench. <abbr title="Lieutenant">Lieut.</abbr>-Colonel de Crespigny
decided to send out two parties: the first consisting
of <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 11 Platoon, under Second Lieutenant
I. FitzG. S. Gunnis, whose task it was to capture,
if possible, a prisoner; and the second under
Second Lieutenant Lord Basil Blackwood with
a party of five men from <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 10 Platoon, who
received orders to reconnoitre in a certain direction.
It was a very dark night, and this was all
in favour of the enterprise, but on the other hand
the difficulties of crossing the canal and advancing
into “No Man’s Land,” where the exact disposition
<!--207.png--><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183"></a><span class="pageno">183</span>
of the German defences were unknown, in
absolute darkness, were only too obvious. The
first obstacle to be overcome was the passage of
the Yser Canal, and this was accomplished by
means of 5-feet mats made of canvas and wire
netting, nailed to wooden slats. Two of these
were used, being placed in position by two
specially detailed parties, and proved most
effective in providing a foothold over the muddy
bed of the canal. Thus the two parties succeeded
in crossing without detection by the enemy.</p>

<p>On arrival on the east side of the canal, Lord
Basil Blackwood led his party on into the darkness,
but instead of the trench which they had expected
to find from a previous study of the aeroplane
map, there was nothing but a mass of shell-holes
with heavy wire entanglement, which made it
difficult for the party to keep together. After
going a considerable distance over rough and
broken ground, rifle-fire was suddenly opened on
them from a dug-out. Lord Basil Blackwood’s
orderly was wounded, while a sapper from the
Royal Engineers, who formed one of the party,
was killed. The remainder at once lay down
in shell-holes, and as they waited bombs were
thrown at them from the same direction. Owing
to the two men who originally followed him
having become casualties, the party now became
scattered. Beyond this point little is known. A
corporal of the Royal Engineers who accompanied
the party, and who was wounded, said that he saw
Lord Basil Blackwood crawl forward after the
shots were fired, but subsequently lost sight of
him. The two remaining men of the Grenadiers
<!--208.png--><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184"></a><span class="pageno">184</span>
assert that they saw him fall, but that owing
to the darkness they completely lost touch with
him, and after crawling about for some time
they returned to the canal bank. Unfortunately
they omitted to report all this to their Company
Commander, Captain Walker, who with Colonel
de Crespigny and Major Bailey was waiting on
the canal bank for any news of the raiding party.
It did not at first occur to Captain Walker that
anything was amiss, but when time wore on, and
Lord Basil Blackwood failed to return, he became
uneasy. The difficulty was, however, that no
one could be found to give any information which
would enable a patrol to go out with any hope of
tracing the missing party.</p>

<p>The movements of the other party under
Second Lieutenant Gunnis are even more obscure.
After crossing the canal, one portion of the party
went on to form a block on the north side, whilst
the remainder worked south in search of a
prisoner. Eventually they found a German
trench and walked down it, until an obstruction
of barbed wire made farther progress impossible.
As the sides were too steep to admit of egress,
Second Lieutenant Gunnis gave the order to turn
about, with the intention of retracing his steps
and getting out farther back. The order was
apparently misunderstood, and some of the men
became detached. Second Lieutenant Gunnis
then entered another trench. He went along it
until he was suddenly fired at, at very close range.
Undeterred by this, he retired a short distance
and returned again outside the trench. Having
passed the point from which he was fired at, he
<!--209.png--><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185"></a><span class="pageno">185</span>
appears to have lost direction, for he went on
until he came upon the dead body of a British
soldier, most probably that of the Engineer, who
had accompanied Lord Basil Blackwood’s party.
He told the two men next to him to carry the
body back. He intended the remainder of the
party to follow him, but, owing to the darkness,
combined with the broken state of the ground,
the orders were misunderstood. At that moment
several bombs were thrown. The men took what
cover they could in shell-holes. When the bombing
ceased Second Lieutenant Gunnis was no
longer with the party. Whether he walked on
under the impression that the others were following
him, or whether he was killed by a bomb it is
impossible to say. The enemy about this time
sent up S.O.S. signals which brought down a
heavy barrage on the British lines, and this no
doubt prevented the survivors of the party returning
in time to enable a patrol to go out
before daylight.</p>

<p>During the following day the shelling continued
intermittently, but it was not until the
5th that the Germans began to search the ground
in earnest. Two heavy Minenwerfers were firing
from the left front, and the bombs were falling
near the support line. The range was gradually
lengthened until the Battalion Headquarters
were reached. Then came a gas alarm, but the
discipline was so good, and gas helmets were put
on so promptly, that although a large number of
gas shells pitched on our front line, there were
no casualties. On the 6th the shelling continued,
and one shell pitched in the support line, wounding
<!--210.png--><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186"></a><span class="pageno">186</span>
Lieutenant Hermon-Hodge and three sergeants,
one of whom subsequently died.</p>

<p>On the 7th the Battalion was relieved, and
retired into billets at Roussel Farm, where it
remained until the 11th, ostensibly for a rest,
though the men were constantly employed in
carrying material to the front line. On the 11th
they went up into the support system, where they
were employed in repairing the trenches which
were being constantly blown in by shell-fire.
All available officers and <abbr title="Non Commissioned Officer">N.C.O.</abbr>’s were taken
over the ground which had been selected as the
forming-up area of the Battalion in the coming
offensive, and were shown objectives and landmarks.
On the 13th the Battalion was relieved
and marched to Elverdinghe, where it entrained
for Proven. On the following day it marched
to Honflond, where it remained for a fortnight,
carefully practising every stage of the attack over
ground exactly representing the German lines,
until even the men knew by heart the lie of
the land and the position of the strong points
and farmhouses. On the 15th Lieutenant F. A.
Magnay arrived, and on the 16th Lieutenant
G. R. Westmacott and Second Lieutenant S. H.
Pearson joined the Battalion. On the 28th the
Battalion moved up to Roussel Farm, and then
to the Forest Area, preparatory to taking part in
the offensive on the 31st.</p>

<p>April was spent by the 3rd Battalion in road-mending,

occupied in training.</p>

the Battalion until the 10th, when Major Rasch
returned. On the 17th the Battalion relieved
the 1st Battalion Scots Guards in the support
line with their headquarters at Bluet Farm, and
although at first there was not much firing the
shelling increased in intensity each day, with
the result that there were quite a number
of casualties. On the 22nd the Battalion was
relieved, and returned to Roussel Farm, where it
remained until the end of the month. There
were a great number of hostile aeroplanes over
this part of the line, and the men had constantly
to be warned to keep under cover.
The Battalion spent another two days in the
trenches on the 26th, and came in for a great
deal of shelling. Second Lieutenant B. J. Dunlop
had a lucky escape; he had just been called
away from the bomb-store, where he had been
all day, when a high-explosive shell pitched
on it, killing the men to whom he had been
speaking.</p>

<p>On July 1 the 3rd Battalion went to Wylders,
and the following day moved on to Herzeele.
Every detail of the projected attack on the 31st
was carefully rehearsed over specially prepared
trenches, and every officer and <abbr title="Non Commissioned Officer">N.C.O.</abbr> was made
familiar with the plan of the German lines and
the prominent landmarks. On the 12th <abbr title="Lieutenant">Lieut.</abbr>-Colonel
Thorne resumed command of the Battalion,
and Major Rasch went to hospital, his
place as Second in Command being taken by
Captain Ridley. On the 13th the Battalion
moved up to the Forest Area and was bivouacked
in two fields. The enemy’s aeroplanes were so
busy overhead that the greatest attention had
to be paid to “camouflage,” and everything had
to be hidden as far as possible. The men were
constantly employed in carrying up ammunition
and war material to the front trenches, an
arduous and dangerous task since they were
continually under shell-fire. Private Bignell of
<!--214.png--><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190"></a><span class="pageno">190</span>
<abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 4 Company behaved with great coolness and
gallantry in carrying from a dug-out a box of
Véry lights which had been set on fire by a pineapple
bomb. For this he received the Military
Medal.</p>

<p>On the 18th Second Lieutenant W. H. S.
Roper joined, and on the 21st the Battalion took
over the right Brigade Sector near Boesinghe, with
<abbr title="Numbers">Nos.</abbr> 1 and 2 Companies in the front trench. For
five days the Battalion remained in the trenches,
during which time it suffered much from shell-fire.
Second Lieutenant H. R. Ogle was wounded
but remained at duty, and the casualties among
other ranks were 27 killed, 11 died of wounds,
45 wounded, 10 gassed, 7 to hospital from concussion.
Second Lieutenant G. Webster made an
excellent reconnaissance of the Canal, and discovered
four places where it could be crossed
without the men getting very wet. <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 4 Company
was to have carried out a raid to ascertain the
strength of the enemy, but at the last moment the
order was cancelled. On the night of the 26th
the Battalion was relieved by the 3rd Battalion
Coldstream Guards, and retired again to the Forest
Area to rest before the attack by the Division on
the 31st.</p>

<p><abbr title="Lieutenant">Lieut.</abbr>-Colonel G. Hamilton, having been given
a command in England, left to take up his duties
and was succeeded by Captain (Brevet Major)
the Viscount Gort, <abbr title="Distinguished Service Order">D.S.O.</abbr>, <abbr title="Member Royal Victorian Order">M.C.</abbr> , <abbr title="Military Cross">M.C.</abbr> After
a fortnight at Clery the 4th Battalion moved to
Cartigny, where it remained for six weeks. On
arrival it had to pitch camp on sodden ground.
Though it was snowing hard and almost dark,
the men managed in an incredibly short time to
collect timber from the ruined houses, bring
up braziers and pitch tents, so that a tolerably
habitable camp soon sprang up. On the
14th Captain M. Williams assumed temporary
command of the 58th Prisoners of War Company.
<!--216.png--><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192"></a><span class="pageno">192</span>
The greater portion of the Battalion worked on
the railway, but each company in turn remained
behind to do steady drill.</p>

<p>By degrees the Battalion made itself very
comfortable, and a canteen with a recreation
room was built, two football grounds were made,
and a cricket-ground begun. The pioneers of
the Battalion collected the debris from the neighbouring
ruins and erected stables and various
other buildings. On the 23rd the work on the
railway ceased, and all the companies were left
at the disposal of the Commanding Officer.</p>

<p class="sidenote">May.</p>

<p>The 4th Battalion remained at Cartigny until
May 18, practising all the latest developments
of the attack, but the work on the railway again
claimed three companies, and it was only occasionally
that the Commanding Officer had the whole
Battalion at his disposal for training purposes.
Second Lieutenant R. G. West joined the
Battalion on the 1st of May, Second Lieutenant
R. C. Denman on the 2nd, Second Lieutenant H.
W. Windeler on the 16th, and on the 12th Second
Lieutenant N. A. Pearce was appointed Transport
Officer. On the 18th the Battalion marched
to Bronfay, and on the way was inspected by
Major-General Feilding commanding the Guards
Division. The following day it proceeded to
Corbie, where it remained training until the end
of the month.</p>

<p class="sidenote">June.</p>

<p>At the beginning of June it moved on by train
to Le Rons. Second Lieutenant J. M. Chitty
joined the Battalion on the 4th, and Second
Lieutenant F. R. Oliver and Second Lieutenant
J. J. M. Veitch on the 7th. Company training
<!--217.png--><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193"></a><span class="pageno">193</span>
and musketry were carried out during the fortnight
spent at Le Rons, and on the 17th the
Battalion moved to Herzeele, where the whole
Brigade manœuvred together. On the 21st
Captain E. O. Stewart joined the Battalion, and
on the 29th Second Lieutenant D. J. Knight
arrived.</p>

<p>The 4th Battalion now made its way to the
area opposite the portion of the German line
which had been selected for an attack on July
31. The camp consisted of a few bivouac sheets
in a wood, and was well within the range of the
German shells; almost as soon as the Battalion
arrived some shells fell in the Transport lines,
but fortunately did no damage. <abbr title="Lieutenant">Lieut.</abbr>-Colonel
Lord Gort went up to the line to make himself
acquainted with the trenches from which the
Battalion would attack, and took with him Captain
Paton, Lieutenant Pixley, and Lieutenant Burke.
During the first week in July the Battalion had
to find between 500 and 600 men for fatigues in
the forward area. On the 5th the camp was
again shelled, but luckily there were no casualties.
Lord Gort made a second visit to the front line,
and took with him this time Captain the <abbr title="Honorable">Hon.</abbr>
F. E. Needham, Captain Greville, Captain Keith,
and Lieutenant Lord E. Hay. During these
days there were constant gas alarms, and on one
occasion the men were ordered to sleep with their
helmets in the ”alert” position.</p>

<p>July 14 was a red-letter day for the 4th
Battalion, as it was the second anniversary of its
formation, but owing to the large number of
men required for fatigue work Lord Gort decided
to keep this anniversary on the 15th. The
celebrations consisted of a football match, a tug-of-war,
and a sergeants’ dinner, followed by a
Battalion concert, and last, but not least, a free
<!--219.png--><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195"></a><span class="pageno">195</span>
issue of beer to all the men. The Corps Commander,
Lord Cavan, attended the sergeants’
dinner, and made a speech which aroused the
greatest enthusiasm. Major-General G. Feilding
also attended.</p>

<p>The fatigue parties worked day and night,
and as the work necessitated going up into the
front trenches there were almost daily a number
of men wounded. On the 16th the Battalion
moved up nearer to the front line and received
orders to raid the German trenches on the whole
Divisional front in eight different places. The
men selected for this were trained separately,
and for three days the raid was rehearsed so that
every man knew exactly what to do.</p>

<p>On the 18th the Battalion moved up into the
front line of the Boesinghe Sector, and was
unlucky enough to come in for considerable
artillery fire while the relief was being carried
out, as the enemy put up the S.O.S. signal,
when he was being raided by the neighbouring
Brigade. As soon as the relief was completed,
gas was discharged from our Stokes mortars,
while the enemy’s artillery put down a heavy
barrage on our front line. <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 1 Company was
placed in the front line; <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 2 Company placed
two platoons in S line and two platoons in Y line;
and X line was occupied by <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 4 Company.
The raiding parties from <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 3 Company were
posted at Paradou Farm.</p>

<p>At 1 <span class="sc small">A.M.</span> on the 20th the raids took place,
and in accordance with the orders received the
German front line was penetrated in four places.
<abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 1 party started off, and had nearly reached
<!--220.png--><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196"></a><span class="pageno">196</span>
the German line when it found that the mat
which had been provided to help it over the
mud was too short. There was nothing to be
done but to plunge into the Canal, and in spite
of being up to their knees in mud the men
succeeded in entering the German trench at the
right place. After moving down the trench for
100 yards, they came upon a German double
sentry post which was engaged in sending up
Véry lights. They determined to work round
this post, but one of the raiders lost his head, and
fired point-blank at the Germans. This would
in any case have raised the alarm, but in addition
to this another of the raiders dropped a bomb,
killing his neighbour and wounding himself, so
that all attempt at surprise was at an end. The
German sentries rushed off yelling, but had not
gone far when one of them dropped dead.
Showers of Véry lights were soon sent up by
the Germans in rear, and men were seen advancing
with bombs and hand grenades in all directions.
This raiding party therefore withdrew,
bringing with it the body of the man who had
been killed by the bomb. They were able to see
a good deal of the German trench, and reported
it to be badly knocked about.</p>

<p><abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 2 party under Second Lieutenant T. T.
Pryce was more successful. The mat in this
case was the right length, and enabled the men
to cross over the mud quickly. They saw five
Germans, who immediately ran over the Yperlee
into Crapouillot Wood. They visited two
German dug-outs, but found them unoccupied
and empty, and reported that they had some
<!--221.png--><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197"></a><span class="pageno">197</span>
difficulty in moving along the trench, which was
badly damaged. <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 3 party arrived at its
destination without difficulty, but the Germans
who had bolted across the Yperlee opened fire on
it from the opposite bank. The raiders afterwards
claimed that they had silenced this fire
with bombs, but there was no evidence to prove
that they succeeded in killing any of the enemy.
However, they were able to make a tolerably
accurate report on the state of the trench.</p>

<p><abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 4 party was heavily handicapped, as the
part of the parapet over which it had to start
was on the sky-line, and therefore clearly visible
to the enemy. No sooner had the men started
than the alarm was given, and they found the
Germans waiting for them. Again the mat
proved too short, and the men were obliged
to advance knee-deep in mud. Bombs were
thrown at them from the start, and one bomb
reached the covering party, wounding all three
men. Sergeant Waterfall was hit as he topped
the parapet, but continued to advance, and
succeeded in effecting an entry into the German
line. Then a regular bombing fight took place,
during which Sergeant Waterfall was again
wounded and knocked down into a shell-hole.
The Germans determined to catch this raiding
party, and commenced an outflanking manœuvre
on each flank, but this attempt was stopped by
the covering party and mat men. There was
no object in pursuing the enterprise any further,
and the raiders therefore returned bringing back
with them the eight wounded men.</p>

<p>On the whole the result of these raids was very
<!--222.png--><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198"></a><span class="pageno">198</span>
satisfactory, and a great deal of valuable information
was obtained, but none of the parties
succeeded in bringing back a live prisoner. It
had been proved that the enemy only held his
front line in posts, all of which had been located,
and that the concrete dug-outs or pill-boxes were
what the Germans mostly relied on for protection.
The wire on the whole length of the trench,
although not continuous, was passably good, and
formed an obstacle difficult to pass.</p>

<p>On the 23rd the Battalion was relieved by
the 2nd Battalion Scots Guards, and retired to
Battle Area Camp, having lost 3 men killed, 1
died of wounds, and 10 wounded during the three
days it had been in the front line. In this camp
it remained until the 31st.</p>

<h4 class="h4head">BOESINGHE, JULY 1917</h4>

<p class="center"><i>Diary of the War</i></p>


<p class="sidenote">July 1917.</p>

<p class="p2 unindent"><span class="sc">During</span> this month the Germans made a determined
attack on Nieuport in the Dune country
near the coast, and succeeded in penetrating
600 yards into the British line, in spite of the
stout resistance of the British troops; but a
counter-attack was successfully launched, and
restored the line to its original position. At the
end of July a combined attack by the British
and French troops in Flanders commenced in the
neighbourhood of Ypres.</p>

<p>On the French front the Germans made strong
attacks on the Chemin des Dames and gained
some ground after severe fighting, but a week
later the French were able to regain all the lost
ground.</p>

<p>The Russians, under General Korniloff, advanced
in Galicia, and even gained some victories
over the Austrians, but disaffection was beginning
to show itself among the men, and the Germans
found no difficulty in driving them back over
the frontier. This retirement on the part of the
<!--226.png--><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200"></a><span class="pageno">200</span>
Russians ended in an ignominious retreat and
open mutiny.</p>

<p>London was raided by a large number of
German aeroplanes, and many people were killed
and wounded by the bombs which were dropped.</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="sc">The Guards Division</span></p>

<p class="p1">When the attack on the Boesinghe Sector was
decided upon, the great difficulty of crossing the
Canal under the enemy’s artillery fire at once
presented itself to the Corps and Divisional
Commanders. It would be necessary to construct
bridges, and under an accurate barrage
the loss of life entailed in crossing the Canal
would certainly be very heavy. Lord Cavan
thoroughly appreciated the drawbacks, but
thought a well-organised attack would succeed.
He ordered every detail of the attack to be
carefully rehearsed over dummy representations
of the Canal and the German trenches, and by
the end of July every officer, <abbr title="Non Commissioned Officer">N.C.O.</abbr>, and even
every man knew exactly what he had to do.
During this time the enemy seem to have been
completely ignorant of the preparations that
were being made, and imagined that so long as
their positions farther south remained intact
there was small probability of an attack on this
sector of the line.</p>

The date of the attack, or zero day, was
originally fixed for the 28th, but on the 24th
it was postponed until the 31st. About a week
before zero day British aeroplanes reported that,
although the German trenches were fully manned
at dawn, the greater part of the garrison was
withdrawn during the day to avoid the shells.
A small incident occurred which left no doubt in
General Feilding’s mind on this point. Two
wounded British soldiers who had been left
behind during a night raid were observed on
the far side of the Canal, and Lieutenant C. J.
Hambro and Private Smith of the 3rd Battalion
Coldstream Guards volunteered to go across the
Canal and bring them in. This they succeeded
in doing, and Lieutenant Hambro reported that
not only had he not been fired on during his
successful venture, but that he had seen no signs
of the enemy at all.</p>

<p>General Feilding thereupon conceived the
audacious plan of seizing the Canal in broad
daylight without the aid of an artillery barrage.
If the information which he had gained was
correct, the enterprise would certainly succeed,
but if on the other hand the absence of the
Germans was only momentary, as had so often
happened, it might prove a costly failure. He
decided not to wait but to strike at once, and
accordingly sent for <abbr title="Lieutenant">Lieut.</abbr>-Colonel Crawfurd commanding
the 3rd Battalion Coldstream Guards,
and told him to send out strong patrols properly
supported at 5 <span class="sc small">P.M.</span> as far as Baboon Support
Trench, Artillery Wood, and Cactus Junction.
As the matter was urgent, these orders were given
verbally, and were later confirmed in writing,
but it was not found possible to start before 5.20.
The whole scheme, although planned at a moment’s
notice, was well thought out. The patrols pushed
forward closely followed by supporting platoons
<!--230.png--><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202"></a><span class="pageno">202</span>
and moppers-up, and succeeded without difficulty
in reaching their objectives, where they surprised
the Germans who had been left in charge of the
trenches. Many prisoners were made, but so
quickly and unobtrusively was the raid carried
out that the Germans in rear were totally
ignorant of what was happening in front. The
Division on the right attempted a similar raid
somewhat later, but owing to no moppers-up
having been ordered to accompany the raiders,
the patrols were captured or killed by Germans
who emerged from dug-outs in rear of them. The
following day, however, it succeeded in gaining
a foothold on the farther bank of the Canal.</p>

<p>For the best part of two days the 3rd Battalion
Coldstream Guards remained in its advanced
positions unmolested. When the men of a
German patrol advanced on their usual rounds,
they were allowed to enter the trench, and were
then quietly made prisoners. On the 29th an
officers’ patrol sauntered along down a communication
trench quite unconscious of the danger
it was approaching; the officer himself and the
leading men were made prisoners, but the <abbr title="Non Commissioned Officer">N.C.O.</abbr>
in rear escaped, although he was fired upon.
Presumably he dashed off, and telephoned that
the front German trenches were in our hands.
It was not long before enemy aeroplanes came
soaring over at a comparatively low height to
investigate the situation, and then the enemy’s
artillery deluged these trenches unmercifully with
shells.</p>

<p>However, the Canal had been gained, and the
enormous advantage of this could not well be
<!--231.png--><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203"></a><span class="pageno">203</span>
over-estimated. The attack was started on the
far bank, and thus hundreds of men were saved
from being killed in the initial stages.</p>

<p>On the night of the 29th the 3rd Battalion
Coldstream Guards and 1st Battalion Irish
Guards were relieved by battalions from the 2nd
and 3rd Guards Brigades. On the left the 1st
Battalion Grenadiers and 1st Battalion Welsh
Guards from the 3rd Guards Brigade, and on the
right the 1st Scots Guards and 2nd Irish Guards
from the 2nd Guards Brigade, moved up to take
over their attack frontages.</p>

<p>The first objective, or Blue line, consisted of
Cariboo Trench, Wood 15 Trench, and Wood 15.</p>

<p>The second objective, or Black line, some 600
yards farther on, ran parallel to the Pilckem
road.</p>

<p>The third objective, or Green line, was not a
line of trenches, but an imaginary line 100 yards
beyond the Iron Cross&mdash;Kortekeer Cabaret road.</p>

<p>The fourth objective, or Dotted Green line, was
not parallel to the others, and while it crossed
<!--232.png--><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204"></a><span class="pageno">204</span>
the Steenbeek on the right joined up with the
Green line on the left. The total depth was about
1¾ miles from the Canal.</p>

<p>The French First Division was on the left, and
the Thirty-eighth Welsh Division on the right of
the Guards Division.</p>

<p>The 2nd and 3rd Guards Brigades were to
take the first three objectives, and the 1st Guards
Brigade was then to pass through and secure the
fourth. In the 2nd and 3rd Brigades the leading
Battalions were responsible for the first and
second objectives, and the Battalions in support
for the third.</p>

<p>So carefully had the whole attack been
rehearsed that from the first there was never
a moment’s hesitation: each Company knew
exactly what was expected of it. If General
Feilding with his staff had thought out every
eventuality, he could not have asked for more
prompt execution of his orders. Each successive
objective was captured exactly according to the
time stated in the orders. The creeping barrage
was perfect. The Field Companies of the Royal
Engineers did admirable work, and nothing could
have been better than the arrangements for
bringing up ammunition, water, and rations.
There appears to have been no hitch throughout
the attack.</p>

<p>Ponsonby’s Brigade on the right occupied the
frontage from the railway to Boesinghe Bridge,
while Seymour’s Brigade continued the line to the
left for 600 yards. The frontage of Ponsonby’s
Brigade, although much smaller than that of
Seymour’s, included more enclosed and difficult
<!--233.png--><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205"></a><span class="pageno">205</span>
country with many strong points. Whether it
was wise to have the railway as a boundary
between the Guards and the Thirty-eighth
Division is open to doubt. There was a number
of concrete block-houses on the railway which
gave a great deal of trouble, and required the
united efforts of the troops on the flanks of
both Divisions. Now the junction of two Divisions
is admittedly the weakest part in the line,
and therefore it would have been better had
the difficult task of capturing these block-houses
been entrusted wholly to one Division.</p>

<p>These concrete block-houses or “pill-boxes”
were built in the ruins of the numerous farms
scattered about the country. They were cunningly
concealed under old roofs and screened
from frontal view by bricks and rubble, and
the tops were often covered with old tiles, grass,
or earth. They were generally built to accommodate
eight or twelve men, and were strong
enough to resist a direct hit from a field-gun or
light howitzer, but their weakness seems to have
been the restricted field of fire from the loopholes.
This enabled troops to work round them
and often close up to them without difficulty.</p>

<p>The morning was excessively dark and cloudy,
although it was not raining. Zero hour was at
3.50, but it was not until 4.10 <span class="sc small">A.M.</span> that the
2nd Battalion Irish Guards and 1st Battalion
Scots Guards advanced in four waves, with
an interval of 100 yards between each wave,
moving at the rate of 100 yards in four minutes
behind the creeping barrage. The first objective
was captured at 4.30. During the barrage
<!--234.png--><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206"></a><span class="pageno">206</span>
which the enemy’s artillery put down on the
Canal, the Scots Guards had the misfortune to
lose the services of their Commanding Officer,
<abbr title="Lieutenant">Lieut.</abbr>-Colonel Romilly, who was wounded by a
shell, and soon after the attack started <abbr title="Lieutenant">Lieut.</abbr>-Colonel
E. B. Greer commanding the 2nd Battalion
Irish Guards was killed. This was a serious loss
to the Guards Division, as he had proved himself
a most able officer.</p>

<p>Punctually the attack on the second objective
started, and although the pill-boxes proved hard
nuts to crack, the Black line was successfully
taken. The Scots Guards had their right flank
constantly exposed to enfilade fire from the railway,
and were consequently obliged to throw
back a defensive flank, so that when they reached
the Black line they had hardly sufficient men for
the front allotted to them. The 3rd Battalion
Grenadiers and 1st Battalion Coldstream in support,
however, made good the deficiency when
they advanced to the third objective. The 3rd
Battalion Grenadiers which passed through the
Scots Guards had to contend with precisely the
same difficulty, and as it advanced was continually
obliged to leave men to guard its right flank.
In spite of all this, the Green line fell into our
hands, and was at once consolidated.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the 1st Battalion Grenadiers and
1st Battalion Welsh Guards in Seymour’s Brigade
had the advantage of starting the attack from
Baboon Reserve Trench some 500 yards on the
far side of the Canal, and had to wait some
time to enable Ponsonby’s Brigade to come up on
their right. They advanced behind the creeping
<!--235.png--><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207"></a><span class="pageno">207</span>
barrage and had no difficulty in reaching the
first objective. Nor did the Black line present
any great stumbling-block, although the casualties
here were heavier. As soon as this line was
consolidated, the 4th Battalion Grenadiers and
2nd Battalion Scots Guards passed through and
attacked the Green line. Here there was a slight
delay, as the French Division on the left was
held up near Colonel’s Farm. It was only a
momentary check, and as the 2nd Battalion
Scots Guards passed this farm the French were
able to capture it. So the Green line was
reached.</p>

<p>The moment had now arrived for Jeffreys’
Brigade to pass through, and the 2nd Battalion
Grenadiers on the right, and the 2nd Battalion
Coldstream on the left, taking up the whole
Divisional frontage, swept over the ground in
perfect formation. The task of the Grenadiers
involved the more severe fighting, since they
were confronted with a large number of “pill-boxes.”
They also had the same difficulty as
their predecessors with the railway, but after
severe fighting succeeded in one place in gaining
a foothold on the farther side of the Steenbeek
River. <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 2 Company of the 2nd Grenadiers,
on the extreme right, reached the river, but
found it impossible to cross it. Although the
Coldstream did not encounter so much opposition,
they had to wheel to the left in the course of the
advance&mdash;by no means an easy manœuvre when
the shells were falling thick; but they carried out
their task most successfully, and joined up with
the Grenadiers. By 11 <span class="sc small">A.M.</span> Brigadier-General
<!--236.png--><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208"></a><span class="pageno">208</span>
Jeffreys was able to report that, except by the
extreme right Company, all the objectives had
been secured. No counter-attack was attempted
against the front held by the Guards Division,
no doubt because the Germans were thoroughly
disorganised.</p>

<p>At the end of the attack our barrage became
thin and uncertain, making it impossible for the
companies in front to send out patrols; but when
it became dark the barrage ceased, and the 2nd
Battalion Coldstream Guards succeeded in establishing
advanced posts at Pinson and Sentier
Farms.</p>

<p>During the advance the dash and gallantry
displayed by the 201st French Regiment on
the left, often in circumstances of exceptional
difficulty, gained the admiration of the whole
Guards Division. The ground over which it
passed was covered with block-houses; there
were several strong posts which had to be reckoned
with; but in spite of all this it managed to keep
pace with the Division.</p>

<p>The total casualties in the Guards Division
during these operations were 59 officers and
1876 men, while 750 Germans were taken prisoner,
and 30 machine-guns and 1 howitzer were
captured.</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="sc">The 3rd Battalion</span></p>

<p class="p1">On the evening of the 30th of July the 3rd
Battalion left Forest Area, and moved up with
the remainder of the 2nd Brigade to the assembly
area on the western side of the Canal. On the
<!--237.png--><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209"></a><span class="pageno">209</span>
way it halted in a field just east of Elverdinghe,
and the men were provided with hot tea and
rum. This halt had a very good effect, for
not only did it give the men rest on a long and
tiring march, but it saved them from the nervous
tension of a long period of waiting in the line
for the battle to begin.</p>

<p>The east side of the Canal had fallen into our
hands a few days previously, and it was therefore
possible to hold that side lightly. On the right
of the Guards Division the Thirty-eighth Division
had been equally successful, and had established
itself on the east bank; but it had not been able
to push its line any farther forward.</p>

<p>The 1st Battalion Scots Guards and the 2nd
Battalion Irish Guards were to be in the front
line, and their leading companies were to start
from the farther side of the Canal, which had
fallen into our hands a few days previously.
The 3rd Battalion Grenadiers and 1st Battalion
Coldstream were in reserve some 400 yards from
the Canal. The two leading Battalions were to
take the first and second objectives, and the two
Battalions in reserve were then to pass through
and secure the third objective. The final objective
was left to the 1st Guards Brigade, which
formed the Divisional Reserve.</p>

<p>The whole Brigade took up its battle positions
without any difficulty: the two leading Battalions
each placed two companies less two platoons
on the farther bank, and left two platoons as
moppers-up on the western bank. The shelling
of the Canal by the German artillery never ceased
for a moment, and caused a good many casualties.
The attack was timed to start at 3.50 <span class="sc small">A.M.</span>, but
in order to conform with the creeping barrage
the actual advance of the Brigade did not take
place till twenty minutes later. The leading
Battalions advanced behind the creeping barrage
in four waves, with an interval of over 100 yards
between each wave. The attack was assisted
by a machine-gun barrage: eight guns from
the Divisional Machine-Gun Company were
detailed for this work, as well as the 4th
Guards and the 29th Machine-Gun Companies.
Both by the attacking troops, and by prisoners
who were subsequently taken in the advance,
this barrage was reported to have been most
effective.</p>

<p>The attack was completely successful, and
the first objective or Blue line was secured at
4.30 <span class="sc small">A.M.</span>, but there was naturally a considerable
<!--239.png--><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211"></a><span class="pageno">211</span>
number of casualties, especially on the right,
where the Scots Guards were exposed to enfilade
fire. The 3rd Battalion Grenadier Guards waited
in its trenches until 5 <span class="sc small">A.M.</span>, by which time it was
light; and although the enemy continued with
all the German thoroughness to shell the Canal
itself, it never seems to have occurred to him
to put barrages down farther back. This was
undoubtedly a bad mistake on his part.</p>

<p>At 5 <span class="sc small">A.M.</span>, according to orders, the 3rd Battalion
started off with <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 1 Company under Lieutenant
E. R. Fryer on the right, and <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 2 Company
under Captain the <abbr title="Honorable">Hon.</abbr> F. Eaton on the left.
In support came <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 3 Company, commanded by
Captain W. Neville, while <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 4 Company under
Lieutenant F. Heasman was employed in carrying
up material to the various objectives, and was
directly under the orders of the Brigade. The
passage across the Canal was successfully accomplished,
though owing to the broken bridges there
was a certain amount of delay. In some places,
indeed, these bridges, consisting of petrol tins,
had been so much damaged that there was
practically nothing to walk upon. However, the
barrage thrown on the Canal was by no means
continuous, and as a certain amount of latitude
was allowed in the choice of a crossing, officers
were able to select comparatively safe courses,
with the result that there were no casualties.
Having crossed the Canal, the Battalion advanced
in artillery formation towards Artillery
Wood over the most difficult ground, while the
German artillery sent high-explosive shells over,
directing them to any strong points that might
<!--240.png--><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212"></a><span class="pageno">212</span>
be made use of by the attacking force. So the
3rd Battalion arrived at the Blue line.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the battalions in front had been
pushing on to the second objective or Black line.
This phase of the attack was more complicated,
for the enemy’s machine-guns were scattered
about in “pill-boxes,” which were difficult to
capture, and a great many casualties occurred
not only from the machine-guns, but also from
the German infantry, which was holding positions
in the shell-holes in front of its trenches.</p>

<p>When the 3rd Battalion Grenadier Guards
approached the Black line it found that there
were hardly any British troops in front of it, as
the Scots Guards, having suffered heavy casualties,
were mostly employed in dealing with the “pill-boxes”
on their right. Captain Eaton at once
disengaged <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 2 Company, and brought it up
on the left of <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 1. The enemy’s machine-guns
at Maison Tambour had been very troublesome,
and had caused twenty casualties in <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 1
Company on the way up. Leaving Captain
Neville to deal with this difficulty, Captain Eaton
and Lieutenant Fryer extended their companies
in two waves, and with the help of the Scots
Guards, who were now freed from guarding the
right flank, rushed on, and seized the second
objective or Black line. At the same time
Captain Neville brought up Lewis guns and rifle
grenades, and with the help of hand grenades
succeeded in silencing the obstructive enemy
post. The Adjutant, Lieutenant Henderson,
finding that the Division on the right was not
keeping pace, went out to find the Royal Welsh
<!--241.png--><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213"></a><span class="pageno">213</span>
Fusiliers, but before he was able to accomplish
his mission he was shot through the body, and
eventually carried back into safety.</p>

<p>Although the Black line had been captured,
the situation on the right was still unsatisfactory,
and part of <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 1 Company had to face to that
flank. The duty of reporting the position of the
Battalion to the contact aeroplanes was then
accomplished by waving large flappers above
sheets laid on the ground.</p>

<p>The advance to the third objective or Green
line was now timed to begin, and this was
entrusted to the 3rd Battalion Grenadiers and
1st Battalion Coldstream. As the advance progressed
considerable opposition was met with
from the block-houses on the railway. These
block-houses were also holding up the Thirty-eighth
Division. Nor was <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 2 Company on
the left of the Grenadiers free to advance, as
there were several “pill-boxes” in front of it to be
disposed of. Captain Eaton began to deal with
these methodically, and with the aid of Lewis
guns and bombs demolished each in turn. As
<abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 1 Company approached a house which it
had surrounded, a large white flag was seen to be
waved frantically from one of the apertures, and
eventually three German officers and fifty men
emerged and surrendered.</p>

<p>Captain Neville was occupied in dealing with
the situation on the right, while <abbr title="Numbers">Nos.</abbr> 1 and 2
Companies continued their advance. Just beyond
Wood House he brought up two machine-guns
and got them into action under cover of the
low railway embankment. Lieutenant Dunlop
<!--242.png--><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214"></a><span class="pageno">214</span>
was told to advance with <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 9 Platoon, and
started off most gallantly in the face of a withering
fire when he was shot dead. Captain Neville
at once brought up <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 12 Platoon, while Lieutenant
Borthwick, with <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 11 Platoon, guarded
the right flank. This enabled <abbr title="Numbers">Nos.</abbr> 1 and 2 Companies
to push on and secure the Green line.
During the last advance Captain Eaton had been
unable to keep touch with the 1st Battalion
Coldstream Guards, who had had to bear to the
left to retain touch with the 3rd Guards Brigade,
but on reaching the Green line every unit was
at its allotted post. While Captain Eaton and
Lieutenant Fryer were ordering their Companies
to consolidate the position, Captain Neville
noticed that the Thirty-eighth Division was still
being held up by three “pill-boxes” which were
situated in rear of his Company on the other
side of the railway line. Rifle-fire was quite
useless against 2 feet of ferro-concrete, and he
therefore determined to make a bombing attack.
Though there was, of course, considerable danger
of the attackers being shot by the Thirty-eighth
Division, it seemed the only way of dealing with
this obstruction. The attack was led by Sergeant
Browning and Private Baker, both of whom were
wounded, and was wonderfully successful, the
enemy being completely dislodged from their
position, and losing 20 killed and 42 captured.
<abbr title="Lieutenant">Lieut.</abbr>-Colonel Thorne came up soon after, and
expressed his approval of all the dispositions that
had been made. In order to adhere strictly to
the orders, he told Captain Neville to take his
men from the front line into support, and <abbr title="Lieutenant">Lieut.</abbr>
<!--243.png--><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215"></a><span class="pageno">215</span>
Fryer to occupy the whole of the front-line trench.
At this moment, however, the 2nd Battalion
Grenadier Guards, of the 1st Brigade, was seen
advancing to pass through, and in order to prevent
any confusion Captain Neville decided to wait
until it had passed before sorting out his men.
Having carried out his orders he was just looking
round to see if there were no more men of his
Company in the front line when he was hit by a
bullet.</p>

<p>During the whole attack <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 4 Company,
under Lieutenant Heasman, acted as a carrying
party for the whole Brigade, and was split up
into five small parties of about twenty men, each
under a Sergeant. Yukon packs which the men
wore were of great service for carrying shells and
water-bottles. Each man carried four Stokes-gun
shells and a coil of French wire during the
initial stages of the attack, but later in the day
two or three tins of water were carried instead.
One party made no less than five journeys to
the Blue line, a distance of 1000 yards, and the
average number of journeys was three. After
the third objective had been taken Lieutenant
Heasman received orders to go himself to Battalion
Headquarters, and to send Second Lieutenant
Carrington with the whole of <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 4 Company
up to the second objective to relieve the Scots
Guards.</p>

<p>The total casualties in the 3rd Battalion were
2 officers killed (Second Lieutenant B. J. Dunlop
and Captain G. W. East, <abbr title="Royal Army Medical Corps">R.A.M.C.</abbr>), 4 officers
wounded (Lieutenant K. Henderson, Lieutenant
J. F. Worsley, Second Lieutenant A. G. Elliott,
<!--244.png--><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216"></a><span class="pageno">216</span>
and Captain W. Neville, <abbr title="Military Cross">M.C.</abbr>), whilst among
other ranks there were 26 killed, 113 wounded,
and 12 missing.</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="sc">The 1st Battalion</span></p>

<p class="p1">Although the attack at Boesinghe was, comparatively
speaking, a simple operation, since the
Germans had brought in the “crater zone” theory
of defence, and the ground therefore was not
strongly defended, it was most successful, and
the manner in which the distances between the
various waves were maintained during the attack,
and the promptitude with which the fire positions
were taken up and consolidated, won the
warmest praise from the Brigadier, Lord Henry
Seymour. The morning of the 31st was very
misty, and the enemy’s aeroplanes were unable
to locate the attacking troops and incapable of
directing the barrage. The comparatively light
casualties may therefore be attributed to this
fortunate state of the atmosphere.</p>

<p>The dispositions of the 3rd Guards Brigade
were as follows: The 1st Battalion Grenadier
Guards on the right, and the 1st Battalion Welsh
Guards on the left, were to take the first two
objectives, the Blue and Black lines, while the
4th Battalion Grenadier Guards and 2nd Battalion
Scots Guards were to capture the third objective.
The 1st Guards Brigade was then to pass through
and take the fourth objective or Dotted Green line.</p>

<p>On July 29 the King’s Company under
Lieutenant Pauling and <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 2 Company under
Captain Baker left Forest Camp to take over
<!--245.png--><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217"></a><span class="pageno">217</span>
from the Irish Guards their battle front, while
the officers and men who were not to take part
in the battle returned to Herzeele under Captain
L. Fisher-Rowe. Owing to a most fortunate
reconnaissance by the 1st Guards Brigade, some
days before, advanced positions on the eastern
side of the Canal had been seized by the 3rd
Battalion Coldstream Guards, and had since been
maintained. This proved of the greatest value
to the 1st Battalion, since it enabled the leading
companies to start the attack on the farther
bank, instead of having to cross the Canal
under fire.</p>

<p>As soon as it was dark the King’s and <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 2
Companies crossed the Canal by means of petrol
tin bridges, which swayed so much that several
men fell into the water, until orders were given
that not more than four men at a time were
to cross. Each company pushed forward two
platoons as far as Baboon Reserve Trench,
leaving one platoon in Baboon Support Trench
and the remaining platoon on the Canal bank.
This movement was naturally not carried out
without a certain number of casualties. Captain
Baker and his servant were killed by a direct
hit from a shell, and Acting Company Sergeant-Major
Wheatley of <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 2 Company was wounded
in addition to a number of other ranks. The
Battalion Headquarters, which was on the west
side of the Canal at the end of Bridge Street,
was also constantly shelled, but as <abbr title="Numbers">Nos.</abbr> 3 and
4 Companies remained in Forest Area till the
30th, the greater part of the German shells were
wasted.</p>

<p><!--246.png--><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218"></a><span class="pageno">218</span>
On the 30th, subsections of the 3rd Guards
Brigade Machine-Gun Company and the Trench
Mortar Battery moved up to their assembly
positions. <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 3 Company under Lieutenant
Dashwood and <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 4 under Captain Lawford
moved up into the trenches known as X line,
just short of the Canal. Brigadier-General Lord
Henry Seymour came round as soon as these
positions were taken up to see that everything
was ready. All through the day the two leading
companies in their advanced position came in
for a great deal of shelling, although mercifully
the German artillery did not seem to know their
precise position. Lieutenant Pauling, in command
of the King’s Company, and Lieutenant
Lawrence, who had been sent up to command
<abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 2 after Captain Baker had been killed, were
both wounded, and the two Company Sergeant-Majors,
who had replaced those wounded the
day before, were both killed. These losses were
particularly unfortunate just as the attack was
about to start. It rained intermittently all
day, and the trenches were consequently in a
marshy condition. On the night of the 30th
the Battalion was formed up ready to attack
the following morning.</p>

<p>During the night of the 30th our artillery
bombarded the German artillery with gas shells.
The result was very satisfactory, for, although
the British front line received a good proportion
of shells, the assembly was carried out without
a hitch, and almost without a casualty. Zero
hour was at 3.50 <span class="sc small">A.M.</span>, but, as the 3rd Guards
Brigade was so far in advance of the rest of the
line, the 1st Battalion Grenadiers had to wait till
4.28 <span class="sc small">A.M.</span> before advancing behind the barrage.
The enemy put down a heavy barrage on the
Canal, but seeing no attack start on our front
evidently assumed that none was intended,
and lifted the barrage to another sector. During
this preliminary bombardment Lieutenant
Thrupp had his wrist smashed by a splinter of a
shell, but after he had had it bound up by his
runner he joined the advance, when a bullet
through his leg stopped him a second time.
Although he was carried down to the dressing-station,
he never recovered, and died that evening.</p>

<p class="unindent">There were ten paces between the lines and
seventy-five paces between the waves.</p>

<p>At 4.36 a protective barrage was put down on
the southern half of the Blue line, and a quarter
of an hour later it was continued on the northern
half. The King’s and <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 2 Companies advanced
in perfect order, but so eager were they to get
at the enemy that the officers and <abbr title="Non Commissioned Officer">N.C.O.</abbr>’s
found it difficult to prevent the men going too
fast, and getting dangerously near the creeping
barrage. Owing to the mist the 1st Battalion
went a little too much to the right, but this
tendency was easily corrected later on. At first
the moppers-up did not make many prisoners,
but as the advance continued they found dug-outs
full of Germans, and captured about fifty.
The first objective or Blue line was taken with
comparative case, but just as the Battalion
reached it Captain Lawford and Lieutenant
Dashwood were wounded. The former recovered,
but Lieutenant Dashwood died two days afterwards
in hospital. Within twenty minutes of
the capture of this line the consolidation was
complete. French wire was run out and strong
points were dug. While this was being done the
attack on the second objective or Black line
<!--249.png--><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221"></a><span class="pageno">221</span>
was started by the third wave followed by the
second wave. Everything went like clockwork,
and there was no hitch of any kind. At zero
+ 3 hours and 24 minutes the 4th Battalion
passed through to assault the Green line. <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 3
Company was placed under the direct orders of
the officer commanding the 4th Battalion, and
was ordered to make a strong point just north
of Abri Farm. The 101st French Regiment on
the left was held up for a time, but the 4th
Battalion Grenadiers by its advance lessened the
pressure on the French front and enabled them to
seize the enemy’s strong point at Colonel’s Farm.
While <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 4 Company was consolidating the Black
line Second Lieutenant Chapple was seriously
wounded, and died a few days later in hospital.
As the advance to the third objective started, the
two platoons of the King’s Company, which had
reached the Black line, returned to the Battalion
in the Blue line, and at 9.50 <span class="sc small">A.M.</span> <abbr title="Lieutenant">Lieut.</abbr>-Colonel
Maitland received orders to withdraw his Battalion.</p>

<p>During the attack the 1st Battalion captured
four machine-guns and two Minenwerfers. The
casualties in the Battalion were 2 officers and
24 other ranks killed, 2 officers and 3 other ranks
died of wounds, and 3 officers and 85 other ranks
wounded. The medical arrangements were perfect,
and the whole battlefield was cleared by

At 3.50 <span class="sc small">A.M.</span> the barrage began, and the noise
was terrific. The whole sky blazed, and it
seemed as if every gun that had ever been made
was firing. <abbr title="Numbers">Nos.</abbr> 1 and 4 Companies, followed
by the Battalion Forward Command Party and
the moppers-up, crossed the Canal, moving in
artillery formation. The left of <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 4 Company
was heavily shelled as it crossed, and two platoons
became rather scattered and lost direction.
Second Lieutenant Hubbard with great coolness
succeeded in rallying them and bringing them
back to their correct position. There was at the
time a considerable amount of machine-gun fire
from Crapouillot Wood, and in the terrific noise
and semi-darkness it was not easy to keep the
platoons together. During the first stages of
the advance both companies found it difficult
to recognise landmarks, and compass bearings
had to be used. There was a marked tendency
to mistake Artillery Wood for Wood 15, which
in the circumstances was hardly to be wondered
at. Some loss of direction was inevitable,
and at one time Grenadier, Irish, and
Scots Guards seemed inextricably mixed south
of Artillery Wood. But the private soldier of
to-day is extremely intelligent, and if he can
only see his officer he will disentangle himself,
and get into his right place. Captain Pixley
soon managed to re-form his Company, and
take it on in the right direction, while the
companies and platoons from the other Battalions
sorted themselves out in an incredibly
short time. <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 4 Company had also lost
direction, and had come in for very heavy
<!--252.png--><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224"></a><span class="pageno">224</span>
shelling, but Captain Paton was able by the aid
of his compass to bring it back to the correct
line of advance. A 5·9 shell fell right among
the Battalion Forward Command Party, wounding
many men and throwing it into great confusion.
Lieutenant J. B. Burke quickly reorganised
the party with the few remaining men,
and was able to maintain the chain of communications.</p>

<p>When the Black line was reached, the 4th
Battalion deployed into line. The hostile shelling
had completely died down, and except for some
machine-gun fire from the direction of Abri
Wood the deployment was not interfered with.
A smoke barrage proved most effective, and
completely covered the Battalion as it deployed.
The 1st Battalion had succeeded in capturing
the Blue and Black lines in accordance with the
scheduled time, and the advance on the Green
line now commenced. On the right of the 4th
Battalion was the 1st Battalion Coldstream, and
on the left the 2nd Battalion Scots Guards.
<abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 1 Company was delayed for a short time by
the water surrounding Lapin Farm, but managed
to catch up the barrage again before entering
Abri Wood. The creeping barrage was perfect,
and gave the men great confidence. On the left
of the 3rd Guards Brigade the 101st French
Regiment had been held up by machine-guns,
with the result that the left flank of the Brigade
was in the air. The 2nd Battalion Scots Guards
had to throw back a defensive flank, so as to
keep touch with its neighbours.</p>

<p>There was a considerable amount of machine-gun
<!--253.png--><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225"></a><span class="pageno">225</span>
fire from “pill-boxes” in Abri Wood, and
also enfilade fire from the right, but the advance
was not delayed on this account. The “pill-boxes”
were rapidly surrounded, and the occupants
of dug-outs immediately emerged and
surrendered; only in a few cases was it necessary
to bomb them. Three trench mortars were
captured in a position near Abri Farm, and the
whole attack was most successful.</p>

<p>As soon as the Green line was secured, consolidation
was begun. The front occupied by
the Battalion extended from Captain’s Farm to
Fourche Farm, with strong points at both these
places, and a support line consisting of fortified
shell-holes fifty yards in rear. Machine-guns,
Stokes mortars, and Lewis guns were brought up
and posted at different points in the front line.
<abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 3 Company of the 1st Battalion, which had
been placed under Lord Gort’s orders, dug a
large cruciform post in rear of the support trench,
and by 2 <span class="sc small">P.M.</span> the whole of the defences were
complete and efficiently wired.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the 2nd Battalion Coldstream
Guards had passed through, and had succeeded
in reaching the Green Dotted line, with its left
on Fourche Farm and its right on Signal Farm.
For the first two hours after the Green line had
been captured the shelling was negligible, but
when three German contact aeroplanes flew very
low over the line, and located the Battalion, every
one feared the worst. It was not long before a
heavy bombardment took place, and the shells
fell with alarming rapidity. Captain Pixley had
a somewhat lucky escape: he had selected a
<!--254.png--><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226"></a><span class="pageno">226</span>
concrete dug-out in Captain’s Farm for his
headquarters when he was requested by the 1st
Battalion Coldstream Guards to hand it over
to be used as its Battalion Headquarters. He
had hardly left it when it was blown to pieces
by a shell. He then changed his quarters to a
hut, but had to move farther to the left when the
Battalion took over the whole line, and soon after
he vacated it the hut was demolished by a shell.</p>

<p>Orders were now received for the 4th Battalion
to take over the whole frontage, from Captain’s
Farm to Colonel’s Farm, so that the 2nd Scots
Guards might be withdrawn. This operation was
carried out in pouring rain, and the Battalion
spent a miserable night, being soaked to the
skin and continually shelled. The next morning,
August 1, the trenches were in a shocking condition
owing to the rain, and the shell-holes were
full of water. A heavy bombardment took place
in the morning, and died down later. At 7
that evening the 4th Battalion was relieved by
the 3rd Battalion Coldstream, and returned to
Forest Area Bivouac Camp. Both officers and
men were dead-beat, having had no sleep for
three days: they were so wet that everything
they had with them was ruined by the rain, and
any paper or book was like pulp.</p>

<p>There were 2 officers wounded (<abbr title="Lieutenant">Lieut.</abbr>-Colonel
Lord Gort and Captain C. H. Greville), while the
casualties amongst the other ranks were: killed
15, wounded 94, gassed 1, shell-shock 3, died of
wounds 4, missing 5. On Lord Gort being sent
to hospital, Captain the <abbr title="Honorable">Hon.</abbr> F. E. Needham
took over the command of the Battalion.</p>

<p>The task assigned to the 1st Guards Brigade
was the capture of the farthest objective, after
the first three objectives had been secured by the
<!--256.png--><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228"></a><span class="pageno">228</span>
1st and 2nd Guards Brigades. During the first
phases of the attack the 1st Guards Brigade was
therefore in reserve, advancing in rear so as to be
prepared to pass through the leading Brigades
when the moment arrived.</p>

<p>Zero hour was fixed for 3.50 <span class="sc small">A.M.</span>, and at
4 <span class="sc small">A.M.</span> the 1st Guards Brigade advanced with the
2nd Battalion Coldstream on the left and the
2nd Battalion Grenadiers on the right, moving
in artillery formation. The 3rd Battalion Coldstream
Guards and 1st Battalion Irish Guards
were under the direct orders of the <abbr title="General Officer Commanding">G.O.C.</abbr> Guards
Division. On the right of the Guards Division,
the battalion which had to undertake the attack
on the last objective was the 17th Battalion Royal
Welsh Fusiliers in the Thirty-eighth Division.</p>

<p>During the early stages of the advance the
shelling was very slight, and it was not until the
Canal was reached that the 2nd Battalion began
to suffer casualties. A considerable amount of
shelling was met with on both sides of the Canal,
but the crossing was effected without serious
difficulty, although in places the bridges were
broken, and some of the men fell into the mud.
The Battalion advanced in very good order, the
intervals and distances being kept with great
precision. <abbr title="Lieutenant">Lieut.</abbr>-Colonel de Crespigny, finding
that he was gaining on the time allotted to
him, and noticing that the German barrage
was irregular, gave orders that commanders
of platoons might use their discretion, and halt
occasionally in shell-holes, in order to avoid any
zones which appeared to be receiving particular
attention from the German artillery. The
<!--257.png--><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229"></a><span class="pageno">229</span>
enemy was continually shortening his range, and
there is no doubt that, by avoiding the shelling
as necessity demanded, many casualties were
avoided.</p>

<p>After going on in this way for about 2000 yards
the leading companies, <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 1 under Captain
Buchanan, and <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 2 under Captain Ritchie, <abbr title="Military Cross">M.C.</abbr>,
having come under machine-gun fire, deployed
into line, their example being followed by the
companies in rear. The German barrage seemed
to follow the Battalion as it advanced, but without
ever reaching it. One howitzer shell, however,
fell among the men of the Battalion Headquarters,
knocking over no less than five. When
the Battalion reached a point 500 yards south-west
of the Green line, some 3000 yards from our
old front line, it halted in accordance with orders,
and <abbr title="Lieutenant">Lieut.</abbr>-Colonel de Crespigny went forward to
confer with <abbr title="Lieutenant">Lieut.</abbr>-Colonel Thorne, commanding
the 3rd Battalion. In the meantime the 2nd
and 3rd Guards Brigades had captured the Green
line, which was not a line of trenches but a line
on the map, 100 yards beyond the Iron Cross&mdash;Korteker
Cabaret road, and therefore easily
recognisable as a landmark. At 8.20 <span class="sc small">A.M.</span> the
1st Guards Brigade advanced through the leading
Brigades, which were to dig in and consolidate
the Green line.</p>

<p>When the leading companies of the 2nd
Battalion reached the Green line, Captain Ritchie
with <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 2 Company found, as he expected, the
3rd Battalion Grenadier Guards digging itself
in, and consolidating the line; but Captain
Buchanan with <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 1 Company could find no
<!--258.png--><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230"></a><span class="pageno">230</span>
trace of the 1st Battalion Coldstream Guards,
which should have been on the left of the 3rd
Battalion Grenadiers. As he had arrived somewhat
ahead of his time he commenced to dig in,
as the position was on the crest of a hill and
exposed to a considerable amount of machine-gun
fire. The Company soon began to suffer
heavy casualties. Captain Ritchie on the right
sent word to say that he was being held up by
machine-gun fire from the right, and was being
subjected to enfilade fire from a partially destroyed
house on the east of the Boesinghe-Staden Railway.
He added that he could see no trace of the
Royal Welsh Fusiliers on his right. The whole
line was under machine-gun and rifle fire, and
not long afterwards Captain Ritchie and Lieutenant
Napier were hit by machine-gun bullets,
so that the command of <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 2 Company now
devolved on Lieutenant A. <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> J. Mildmay.</p>

<p>Captain Buchanan considered that while it
was possible to push on he should do so, even if
the Company on his right was unable to advance.
He therefore decided to move forward, and sent
back to Captain Sir A. L. Napier, commanding
<abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 3 Company, asking him to garrison the Green
line. As the 1st Battalion Coldstream Guards,
which, it was afterwards discovered, had gone
too far to the right, did not appear, and as the
Royal Welsh Fusiliers were unable to reach their
objective, the advance was delayed and not continued
until fifteen minutes after the creeping
barrage was timed to move on. However, our
barrage had now become uncertain, shells falling
sometimes far ahead and sometimes alarmingly
<!--259.png--><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231"></a><span class="pageno">231</span>
close, so that the two leading companies could
not well have advanced any sooner. Captain
Buchanan, regardless of the situation on his
flanks, continued to advance with <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 1 Company
in the most gallant manner, and succeeded in
reaching Signal and Ruisseau Farms, where thirty
of the enemy were captured, including a battalion
commander and a number of officers. A platoon
of <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 3 Company, under the command of Lieutenant
Harvard, who showed considerable ability
in handling his men in exceptionally difficult
circumstances, was now sent up as reinforcements.
<abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 1 Company dashed on, and managed to cross
the Steenbeek River, on the farther side of which
it dug itself in.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the position on the right was full
of difficulties. The 17th Battalion Royal Welsh
Fusiliers had been held up, and the usual problem
demanded solution: how to keep pace with
the advance, and at the same time to guard the
exposed flank? A platoon of <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 4 Company,
under Lieutenant Oliver, at once formed a
defensive flank to the right; but this was an
insufficient safeguard, and as <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 2 Company
continued to advance, Lieutenant Mildmay, now
in command, was forced to waste half his strength
in protecting the right flank. Lieutenant Jacob,
who commanded <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 4 Company, sent forward
one platoon to assist <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 2 in their advance,
and after consultation with Captain Buchanan
despatched a third platoon under Second Lieutenant
Drummond to prolong the left of <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 3
Company, which was now advancing in support
of <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 1. This platoon had not gone far before
<!--260.png--><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232"></a><span class="pageno">232</span>
Lieutenant Drummond was wounded by a shell,
but in spite of this, and even another wound in
the neck from a bullet, he insisted on remaining
with his Company until the Battalion was relieved,
dealing coolly with every situation which arose.
During the advance Sergeant Sharpe and two
men captured a block-house 150 yards west of
the railway, securing no less than twenty-one
prisoners.</p>

<p>By now the Royal Welsh Fusiliers had succeeded
in demolishing the block-houses which
impeded their advance, and had gained ground on
the right. This enabled Lieutenant Mildmay to
push on with <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 2 Company to within 80 yards
of the Steenbeek, but there he was held up by
machine-gun fire from Langemarck village. Any
endeavour to cross the river in the circumstances
would be doomed to failure, nor was there
any advantage to be gained by the attempt, since
the men now occupied a position with a good
field of fire dominating the approaches to the
river.</p>

<p>The section of the Machine-Gun Company
which followed the 2nd Battalion during this
advance suffered very much from shell-fire.
Lieutenant Cottle, the officer in command, was
killed whilst going forward to reconnoitre, and
shortly afterwards one of the guns of this section
with its entire team was knocked out by a shell.
The remaining guns, however, were brought up
into good positions in the front line.</p>

<p>Three German aeroplanes made a complete
and leisurely reconnaissance of our position,
although they were freely engaged with Lewis
<!--261.png--><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233"></a><span class="pageno">233</span>
guns and rifle-fire. Meanwhile, the 2nd Battalion
Coldstream on the left, which had not experienced
much opposition, but had had a very difficult
wheel to perform, had succeeded in reaching its
objective, and was established with its left on the
Green line and its right in touch with the 2nd
Battalion Grenadiers on the Steenbeek. As soon
as it was dark, the line was straightened and
strengthened, and touch was established between
all units. A steady downpour of rain commenced
that night and continued unceasingly until the
Battalion was relieved two days later. The ground
became one large morass, and the trenches were
mere ditches, in which the men had to stand up
to their knees in water. The hardships which
the men had to endure cannot be over-estimated.
Not only were they soaked through and covered
with mud, but they were under continual shell-fire.
Being for the most part on the forward
slope of a hill, they were unable to move about
in daylight to keep warm, and no hot food of
any description could be brought up to them.
The only way to ensure warmth was to dig a
new trench at dusk and dawn every day. The
advanced position of the trenches made it a
precarious line to hold, more especially as it was
impossible to dig down very deep on account of the
water. There were consequently many casualties,
amongst whom was Lieutenant K. Harvard, who
was so badly wounded that he never recovered.
He died the same evening at the dressing-station.
The situation was not made easier by the Thirty-eighth
Division on the right, which continually sent
up S.O.S. signals without any apparent reason.
<!--262.png--><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234"></a><span class="pageno">234</span>
This not only brought down our barrage, some
shells of which fell in the Battalion’s own advanced
trenches, but it also caused retaliation from the
enemy’s artillery.</p>

<p>On the night of August 2 the 2nd Battalion
was relieved, and marched to Bluet, where hot tea
was provided. It was a very trying march;
every one was knee-deep in mud, and the weight
of the mud and soaked equipment was almost
intolerable. Later the Battalion moved on to
Elverdinghe in order to entrain for Proven, but
a shell had blown up a part of the line, and no
train was therefore available. A move was made
instead into bivouacs near Cardoen Farm, where
the Battalion remained until lorries arrived to
convey it to Proven.</p>

<p>The casualties amongst the officers were:
Lieutenant K. O’G. Harvard, killed; Lieutenant
R. G. C. Napier, died of wounds; Captain A. T. A.
Ritchie, <abbr title="Military Cross">M.C.</abbr>, Lieutenant J. H. Jacob, Lieutenant
A. S. L. <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> J. Mildmay, and Second Lieutenant
F. H. J. Drummond, wounded. Amongst other
ranks: 44 killed, 191 wounded, 15 missing, 11
slightly wounded.</p>

<p class="sidenote">1917.</p>

<p class="p2 unindent"><span class="sc">There</span> was much fighting on the British front
during these two months. Early in August the
Germans counter-attacked near Ypres, and succeeded
in regaining <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Julien, but only for a
short time, for it was retaken by the British a
week later. On the Ypres&mdash;Menin road there
was fierce fighting; the British gained some
ground north-west of Lens, and also reached the
Bois Hugo. In co-operation with the French
they made good progress in the direction of
Langemarck, and crossed the Steenbeek River.
A general offensive east of Ypres was undertaken
in September, and the line was advanced
considerably.</p>

<p>The French launched a determined attack at
Verdun on an 11-mile front, and captured several
villages.</p>

<p>The Italians advanced in strong force on a 30-mile
front from the Isonzo to the sea, and captured
the Austrian front-line trenches beyond the Piave.
They also had successes at Monte Gabriele and
Val Sagana.</p>

<p><!--264.png--><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236"></a><span class="pageno">236</span>
The Russian <i>débâcle</i> continued, and the Germans
captured Czernowitz and Riga. General Korniloff,
finding that the Army was in a state of
mutiny, marched on Petrograd, apparently with
the intention of taking over the Government
of Russia, but his insurrection ended in failure,
and he was forced to submit to the Provisional
Government under Kerensky.</p>

<p>In Mesopotamia Sir Stanley Maude defeated
the Turks at Ramadie, and there was some
further fighting in East Africa. China declared
war on the Central Powers.</p>

<p>During these months several air raids were
carried out against England, and not only London
but many other towns were severely bombed.</p>

<p class="p1">After the operations at Boesinghe the 1st
Battalion retired for a few days’ rest to Forest
Area, but returned to the front trenches on
August 5. While it was being relieved by the
3rd Battalion Royal Fusiliers, Second Lieutenant
H. G. Johnson was killed. On the 8th it proceeded
to Putney Camp near Proven, where it
remained for four days, and then moved on to
Reinforcement Camp at Herzeele. On the 12th
Captain J. C. B. Grant, <abbr title="Royal Army Medical Corps">R.A.M.C.</abbr>, who had been
attached to the Battalion for over a year, left, and
Captain P. H. Wells arrived to take up the duties
of Medical Officer. On the 26th Second Lieutenant
W. A. Fleet joined from the base, and on
the 22nd Captain A. T. G. Rhodes arrived. At
<!--265.png--><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237"></a><span class="pageno">237</span>
the end of the month the Battalion moved to
Rugby Camp in the Bluet Farm Area.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><abbr title="September">Sept.</abbr>
1917.</p>

<p>On September 1 it went into the line for four
days, and came in for a certain amount of shelling.
Second Lieutenant R. H. Carson received a bad
wound in the side from a shell, and although he
was carried down to the dressing-station, where
it was at first thought that his wound was not
serious, he died the next day. Second Lieutenant

Lieutenant W. A. Fleet was gassed. On
September 5 the Battalion entrained at Lunéville

<p class="p1">The 2nd Battalion reached Plumstead Camp
between Herzeele and Proven on August 3, and
remained there training until the 21st, when it
moved into bivouacs at Bluet Farm. On the 28th
it went to Harrow Camp, and was employed in
carrying up material to the front line. There
was a great deal of promiscuous shelling by the
enemy’s artillery, and one shell pitched on the
cookers of the 3rd Battalion Coldstream Guards,
killing 3 men and wounding 14, while later
<!--267.png--><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239"></a><span class="pageno">239</span>
two of its travelling cookers were blown to
pieces, but the 2nd Battalion only had one man
wounded. On the 31st it moved back out of the
shelled area. During the month the following
officers joined: Lieutenant H. White, Captain
C. N. Newton, <abbr title="Military Cross">M.C.</abbr>, Second Lieutenant R. H. R.
Palmer, and Second Lieutenant H. B. G. Morgan.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><abbr title="September">Sept.</abbr></p>

<p>On September 8 the Battalion took over the
front trenches immediately to the left of the
Staden Railway, where the line was held by a
series of posts running across the Broembeek.
This was a very unpleasant line to occupy, as it
was wet and marshy, and the enemy was able
practically to overlook the trenches. Captain
Walker, <abbr title="Military Cross">M.C.</abbr>, commanded the Battalion, while
Major Rasch temporarily took command of the
Brigade. During the three days in the line, 6
men were killed and 32 wounded. Second Lieutenant
H. B. G. Morgan and three other ranks
were slightly wounded, but remained at duty.
On the 10th the Battalion spent four very disagreeable
days at Rugby Camp, where it was
continually bombed, shelled, and gassed. The
men were employed in carrying up material to
the front line, but considering they were constantly
subjected to shell-fire they suffered very little:
3 men were killed, 3 wounded, and 11 gassed.
Just as the Battalion was leaving camp, six
8-inch shells fell close by, but fortunately without
causing any casualties. After a fortnight
at De Wippe Camp, where it was employed
on fatigues, the Battalion moved on the 23rd
to Plumstead Camp, where it remained until
October 6. On September 22 Brigadier-General
<!--268.png--><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240"></a><span class="pageno">240</span>
G. D. Jeffreys, <abbr title="Companion Order of Saint George">C.M.G.</abbr>, having been given
command of the Nineteenth Division, left the
1st Guards Brigade to take up his new appointment,
and was succeeded by <abbr title="Lieutenant">Lieut.</abbr>-Colonel C.
R. C. de Crespigny. Lieutenant R. Y. T. Kendall
and Second Lieutenant H. D. Stratford joined
the Battalion on the 14th, and Second Lieutenant
G. H. Hanning on the 21st.</p>

<p class="p1">After three days’ rest in Forest Area the 3rd
Battalion went by train to Elverdinghe, and
marched up from there to the front line. While
the relief was being carried out there was a good
deal of shelling, and Second Lieutenant G. V. G. A.
Webster, a keen young officer of great promise,
was killed by a shell. After a week’s rest at
Herzeele, the 3rd Battalion moved into Corps
Reserve, while the Twentieth and Twenty-ninth
Divisions attacked on the 16th. It returned to
Herzeele on the 19th, and on the 22nd went to
De Wippe Camp.</p>

<p>On September 4 the Battalion moved to Eton
Camp, which was close to the railway, and therefore
exposed to attacks by the enemy’s aircraft.
There were no less than forty casualties from
bombs dropped from aeroplanes. On the 12th
the Battalion moved to Rugby Camp, which was
regularly shelled at night, and then took over
the trenches in the Broembeek sector. For four
days it was subjected to considerable shelling,
and on the 20th it prolonged the line to the
left, where the 10th King’s Royal Rifle Corps
<!--270.png--><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242"></a><span class="pageno">242</span>

<p class="p1">The first few days in August were spent by the
4th Battalion in Forest Area; its strength was
made up to 32 officers and 882 men. From the 5th
to the 7th the Battalion went up into the trenches,
where it came in for a good deal of shelling. The
casualties were 15 killed, 35 wounded, 3 missing,
1 case of shell-shock, total 54. Lieutenant J. B.
Burke was slightly wounded, but remained at
duty. A patrol under Second Lieutenant D. J.
Knight was sent out to reconnoitre the ground
on the far side of the Steenbeek, and returned
without having encountered any Germans. On
the 8th the Battalion marched to Zonnerbloom
Cabaret, where it entrained for Proven, whence
it marched to Penton Camp. On the 27th it
proceeded to Herzeele, where Lieutenant M.
Chapman joined, and on the following day
moved up into the line, where it remained for
four days. At first all was quiet, but later shells
began to fall very heavily. Second Lieutenant
Benson took out his platoon from <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 4 Company,
and advanced the bridgehead positions a distance
of 100 yards, thus gaining a fresh field of observation
over three-quarters of a mile. He also went
out with a daylight patrol to locate the enemy,
and succeeded in going as far as 200 yards before
two machine-guns opened fire on his party. One
man was killed by a low-flying aeroplane, which
flew along the front line firing a machine-gun,
and the total casualties during the four days in
the trenches were 4 killed and 7 wounded.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><abbr title="September">Sept.</abbr></p>

<p>On the evening of September 1 the Battalion
<!--272.png--><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244"></a><span class="pageno">244</span>
retired to Rugby Camp near Bluet Farm, where
it remained for a week. On the 5th a German
aeroplane flew over the camp, and dropped bombs,
which wounded Lieutenant R. G. West and Lance-Sergeant
S. G. Bull. After a week at Dublin
Camp a move was made to Charterhouse Camp,
where Lieutenant R. Farquhar, <abbr title="Military Cross">M.C.</abbr>, was killed
by a shell. He was a fearless officer who had
seen much fighting, and already distinguished
himself; his death was a great loss to the
Battalion. On the 21st the Battalion moved to
Herzeele, and on the 24th to Penton Camp,
where it remained training until the operations
of October 5.</p>

<p class="p2 unindent"><span class="sc">The</span> crossing of the Broembeek and the occupation
of the southern edge of Houthulst Forest by
the Guards Division was one of those brilliantly
executed attacks which are apt to be counted
among minor operations simply because of their
success. There had been plenty of time to make
the arrangements, and General Feilding was determined
to ensure the success of the whole operation.
The weather was an important factor, as the
ground was low, and there had been much rain.
If the Broembeek should become swollen by the
rain, it would develop into a serious obstacle, and
the ground, already very deep in places, might become
a morass over which the troops would pass
with difficulty. Two patrols, which had gone out
the week before the attack, reported that mats
would be necessary for crossing the stream, but
the weather fortunately improved, and on the
day of the attack the passage of the Broembeek
presented few difficulties.</p>

General Feilding decided to hold the line with
Seymour’s Brigade until the 9th, and to carry out
the attack with De Crespigny’s Brigade on the
right and Sergison-Brooke’s Brigade on the left.
De Crespigny’s Brigade was to cross the Broembeek
from Panther and Leopard trenches, and
continue on either side of the Koekuit Road
through Vee Bend to its final objective, on the
edge of the forest, from Egypt House to about
800 yards east of Les Cinq Chemins. Sergison-Brooke’s
Brigade, starting from Craonne Farm
and Panther trench, was to advance across the
stream through Ney Wood and Gruyterszaale
Farm to Louvois Farm, and a strong point beyond
on its left, while on the right the group of houses
from Obtuse Bend to Suez Farm was to be taken,
so that the line up to the road to Les Cinq Chemins
on the edge of the wood would be secured.</p>

<p>Brigadier-General Lord Henry Seymour, who
had to hold the original line for the two days
before the attack, placed the 4th Battalion
Grenadiers and 2nd Battalion Scots Guards in
the front trenches, and these two Battalions had
a strenuous time preparing accommodation for
the other two Brigades, and placing mats in
readiness for the crossing of the stream. The
1st Battalion Grenadiers and 1st Battalion Welsh
Guards had also to work hard forming forward
dumps, and dragging guns into their new position.</p>

<p>On the evening of the 7th the relief was
successfully accomplished, and De Crespigny’s
and Sergison-Brooke’s Brigades moved up into
their assembly positions.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><abbr title="October">Oct.</abbr> 9.</p>

<p>At 5.20 <span class="sc small">A.M.</span> on the 9th the attack began.
In De Crespigny’s Brigade, the 2nd Battalion
Grenadiers and 2nd Battalion Coldstream
<!--278.png--><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248"></a><span class="pageno">248</span>
advanced after an intense bombardment, which
lasted four minutes, and having crossed the
stream with comparatively little difficulty secured
the first objective. In Sergison-Brooke’s Brigade,
the 1st Battalion Scots Guards and the 2nd
Battalion Irish Guards succeeded in crossing the
stream, and reaching the first objective by the
appointed time. They, however, experienced
some difficulty at Ney Wood, where the enemy
had posted a strong machine-gun nest.</p>

<p>At 7 <span class="sc small">A.M.</span> the advance to the second objective
commenced, and was equally successful, although
in De Crespigny’s Brigade the 2nd Battalion
Coldstream met with some resistance from a
group of block-houses at Vee Bend.</p>

<p>As soon as the second objective had been
secured, the remaining Battalions in each Brigade
moved up, and passing through the leading
Battalions attacked the third objective. In De
Crespigny’s Brigade the 3rd Battalion Coldstream
and 1st Battalion Irish Guards advanced, but
found that their task was not so easy as that
of their predecessors. Concrete block-houses had
to be disposed of, and in some places a very
determined resistance was encountered. The
Newfoundland Battalion of the 88th Brigade had
been unable to keep pace with the advance of
the Guards Division, whose right flank was consequently
exposed. But the third objective was
reached according to the scheduled time.</p>

<p>In Sergison-Brooke’s Brigade the 3rd Battalion
Grenadiers and 1st Battalion Coldstream encountered
little opposition, and seized Suez Farm,
where they captured two field-guns. The 3rd
<!--279.png--><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249"></a><span class="pageno">249</span>
Battalion Grenadiers reached the third objective
so quickly that it was able to open fire on
the Germans retreating into Houthulst Forest
and inflict on them heavy casualties. The 1st
Battalion Coldstream had some difficulty with a
strong point at Louvois Farm, but after working
round it succeeded in effecting its capture, together
with the forty Germans who formed the garrison.</p>

<p>When the third objective was secured the two
Brigades dug themselves in, and prepared for the
expected counter-attack, but, although the enemy
showed some signs of activity, no actual attack
took place. The position was maintained until
the night of the 10th, when Seymour’s Brigade
took over the line. The 1st Battalion Grenadiers
was placed on the right, the 4th Battalion in the
centre, and the 1st Battalion Welsh Guards
on the left. In order to improve the front
line, and at the same time slightly to alter its
direction, General Feilding decided on a farther
advance. The Welsh Guards had to remain
where they were; the 4th Battalion in the centre
had to advance a short distance, and the 1st
Battalion on the right had to go somewhat
farther. All this was successfully carried out
under a protective barrage, though the 1st
Battalion found it difficult to maintain contact
with the 51st Brigade on the right flank.</p>

<p>The new line was held until the evening
of the 13th, when De Crespigny’s Brigade took
over the line. On the 17th the Guards Division
was relieved, and retired for a period of rest.
The casualties in the Division amounted to 67
officers and 1899 other ranks. The total number
<!--280.png--><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250"></a><span class="pageno">250</span>
of prisoners captured was 28 officers and 1152
other ranks, in addition to 3 field-guns, 1 howitzer,
36 machine-guns, and 9 trench mortars.</p>

<p class="p1 sidenote"><abbr title="October">Oct.</abbr> 7-13.</p>

<p class="p1">On October 7 the 2nd Battalion with the
remainder of the 1st Guards Brigade reached
Charterhouse Camp between the Yser Canal and
Elverdinghe. The afternoon was spent in distributing
fighting stores to the companies who
were to undertake the attack.</p>

<p><abbr title="Numbers">Nos.</abbr> 1 and 2 Companies took up their battle
positions on the night of the 7th, but the relief
<!--281.png--><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251"></a><span class="pageno">251</span>
was long and troublesome owing to the sodden
and shattered state of the ground, and the night
was cold and windy. On the following day <abbr title="Numbers">Nos.</abbr>
3 and 4 Companies came up into their places
behind <abbr title="Numbers">Nos.</abbr> 1 and 2. The day was fine until 4 <span class="sc small">P.M.</span>,
when a steady rain commenced, which increased
to a downpour, and continued until early the next
morning. It was a miserable night for the men
who were going to attack the next morning, and
well calculated to depress the spirits of the
boldest. Rum and rations were sent up in
addition to hot tea, and everything possible was
done to make the position bearable.</p>

<p>The condition of the Broembeek, which ran
parallel to our front line, was a matter for great
anxiety. During the past week patrols had
reported it to be impassable at various places,
and it was feared that the recent rains had
converted it into a serious obstacle. Both
companies sent out patrols to reconnoitre it
during the night without very reassuring results,
although Lieutenant the <abbr title="Honorable">Hon.</abbr> F. Manners found
one or two points at which he was able to wade
across. Mats and light bridges were carried to
the front companies to be used by the leading
waves of the attack.</p>

<p>The 2nd Battalion was on the right of the
Guards Division, with the 2nd Battalion Coldstream
on its left, and the 4th Battalion Worcestershire
Regiment on its right. <abbr title="Numbers">Nos.</abbr> 1 and 2 Companies
were to capture the first objective, and
<abbr title="Numbers">Nos.</abbr> 3 and 4 were then to pass through and
secure the second objective. The capture of the
third objective was allotted to the 1st Battalion
<!--282.png--><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252"></a><span class="pageno">252</span>
Irish Guards, which was to pass through the
Battalion after the second objective had been
taken. The line of advance of the 1st Guards
Brigade was parallel to and 300 yards from the
Staden&mdash;Langemarck railway.</p>

<p>There was no preliminary bombardment, but
at zero hour, 5.20 <span class="sc small">A.M.</span>, an intense barrage from
18-pounder guns and Stokes mortars dropped on
and beyond the Broembeek. It was considered of
the first importance that the effects of the barrage
should not be lost by delay in crossing the stream,
but in the half light its exact line was not easy
to determine, and some casualties were caused by
men pressing too close to it. The stream proved
far easier to cross than was anticipated, and fallen
trees, planks, and duckboards were of great
assistance. The German Division who held this
part of the line appears to have been taken by
surprise, for it made a very poor resistance, and
in places where the crossing was difficult, the curious
sight of Germans holding out their hands to
help our men out of the mud could be seen. Its
line was held by a series of posts, mostly converted
shell-holes. In spite of the line of advance being
oblique to the trench from which they started,
<abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 1 Company under Lieutenant Cornforth,
and <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 2 Company under Captain Sir A. Napier,
managed to keep the direction, and the advance
continued unchecked. Minor adjustments were
necessary from time to time with the Battalion
on the right, which at one time lost direction, and
swerved too far to the left, but the first objective
was gained and consolidated without any great
opposition or serious loss. <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 3 Company under
<!--283.png--><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253"></a><span class="pageno">253</span>
Captain Newton and <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 4 under Lieutenant
Westmacott passed through, and advanced on
the second objective. This attack was equally
successful, and this objective also was secured and
consolidated up to time. Both advances had
been carried out with the greatest steadiness
and precision, and the skilful way in which the
<abbr title="Non Commissioned Officer">N.C.O.</abbr>’s handled their sections was remarkable.
Although the task allotted to the Battalion
had been successfully carried out, its troubles
began after the second objective had been
consolidated. It had hardly had time to make
the position secure, when the enemy’s aircraft
flying very low became unpleasantly attentive,
and soon afterwards it was subjected to a very
heavy shelling from the enemy’s artillery. Lieutenant
Tabor was shot in the ankle, and soon
afterwards Second Lieutenant Stratford was
wounded in the thigh. Captain Sir A. Napier
was slightly wounded, but remained at duty.
The total casualties in the Battalion were 33
killed, 123 wounded, 11 missing, 21 slightly
wounded, total 188.</p>

<p>Patrols which had been sent out by the leading
Battalion reported the ground in front to
be wet and boggy, but passable. <abbr title="Lieutenant">Lieut.</abbr>-Colonel
Thorne sent forward guides to make themselves
thoroughly acquainted with the assembly position,
so that they might lead the Battalion to its destination

task was not without danger, and when Second
Lieutenant Greenhill, who was in charge of the
guides, met the Battalion at Wood 15, his party
<!--285.png--><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255"></a><span class="pageno">255</span>
had already suffered six casualties. At 5.20 <span class="sc small">A.M.</span>
the attack commenced, and the leading Battalions
started off preceded by a barrage. The Broembeek
was crossed without difficulty, and the first
objective was secured according to the scheduled
time. The companies in support then passed
through and captured the second objective. The
3rd Battalion Grenadiers and 1st Battalion Coldstream
received instructions not to cross the
Broembeek until the first objective had been
secured. They accordingly waited until 7.30
<span class="sc small">A.M.</span>, and then advanced. On nearing the second
objective the 3rd Battalion deployed with <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 3
Company under Lieutenant J. C. D. Tetley on
the right, and <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 4 Company under Captain G.
Hirst on the left. <abbr title="Numbers">Nos.</abbr> 1 and 2 Companies under
Captain J. Craigie and Captain W. H. Beaumont-Nesbitt
were in support. The moment had now
arrived for the two rear Battalions to pass through
the troops in front, and attack the third objective.
There were, however, some very strong concrete
posts to be disposed of before the third objective
could be reached, and there seemed every prospect
of desperate fighting. The 1st Battalion
Coldstream had one particularly strong post to
deal with, and by working round the flanks it
succeeded in effecting its capture. Barring the
way of the 3rd Battalion Grenadiers was a concrete
block-house, the garrison of which no doubt
thought it held an impregnable position. Lance-Sergeant
Rhodes determined to silence the fire
from this post, and most gallantly advanced
towards it by himself. His bravery was rewarded
in an astonishing manner, for the whole garrison
<!--286.png--><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256"></a><span class="pageno">256</span>
of eight men surrendered to him under the impression
that he was the leading man of a large
party. For this conspicuous act of gallantry
Sergeant Rhodes was recommended for the V.C.,
the award of which was published on November
27, the day on which he was mortally wounded in
the attack on Fontaine in the Cambrai offensive.</p>

<p>Nor was this the only notable act of gallantry
during the advance, for Lance-Sergeant Horgan
and Lance-Corporal Unsworth, on reaching Suez
Farm, succeeded in capturing two field-guns and
fifteen prisoners. The Germans who took refuge
in dug-outs were a constant trouble; in cases
where they surrendered at once, they were simply
made prisoners. In certain instances, however,
when they imagined they were stronger than
their captors, some of them tried to fight their
way out. In this way three men of <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 4 Company
found a dug-out full of Germans, and there
seemed no reason why they should surrender.
The leading men who emerged from the dug-out,
finding their captors only numbered three, determined
to fight, but were instantly killed, and
the remainder, numbering fifteen, were made
prisoners.</p>

<p>Thus the third objective was secured. Carrying
parties with wire from <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 1 and <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 2
Companies came up, and consolidation was at
once begun. Two machine-guns were also sent
up to be placed at the strong posts east of
Veldhoek Cemetery. In the afternoon the enemy
was seen advancing down the Panama House&mdash;Faidherbe
road, and they were dispersed by
machine-gun fire.</p>

<p><!--287.png--><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257"></a><span class="pageno">257</span>
All through the day the Chaplain, <abbr title="Captain">Capt.</abbr> Phillimore,
behaved with great gallantry, attending to
the wounded and encouraging the men during
the advance&mdash;quite oblivious of the shells and
rifle-fire. When it was dusk the sad task of
burying the dead had to be undertaken, and <abbr title="Captain">Capt.</abbr>
Phillimore stood up with his head uncovered,
and read the service. Although the shells fell
unpleasantly close to the burial-ground, which
was in the open, he refused to shorten the service
in any way, and when one of the men silently
handed him a helmet, he merely shook his head,
and continued to read the service as if there were
no shells.</p>

<p>During the 10th the 3rd Battalion remained
in the line they had captured. About 4.30 <span class="sc small">A.M.</span>
the Germans put down a heavy barrage on our
line, but no infantry attack developed, and the
remainder of the day was quiet. Before nightfall
the Battalion established two strong posts
on the road east of Faidherbe Cross-roads, and
that night, relieved by the 4th Battalion Grenadier
Guards, it retired to H Camp.</p>

<p>Lieutenant F. W. R. Greenhill and Lieutenant
J. C. D. Tetley were killed, and Second Lieutenant
W. H. S. Roper died of the wounds he received.
Lieutenant N. Thornhill and Lieutenant E. G. A.
Fitzgerald were wounded. Among other ranks
there were 13 killed, 61 wounded, 3 missing, and
2 slightly wounded remained at duty.</p>

<p>During the attack the Battalion captured 2
field-guns, 4 machine-guns, 2 trench mortars, and
93 prisoners.</p>

The attack by De Crespigny’s and Sergison-Brooke’s
Brigades was so successful that the
services of Seymour’s Brigade were not required.
Owing to the strenuous work of the previous
nights the men were exhausted, and would have
been glad of some rest, but the bad weather,
wet ground, and constant shelling made their
position far from comfortable. The German
prisoners taken were employed in carrying the
wounded, but they were not sufficient for the
purpose, and 100 men of the 1st Battalion were
told off to assist. Had it not been for this
impromptu assistance, the medical arrangements
would have broken down very badly. On the
night of the 10th a relief was carried out, which
has an especial interest for the Regiment: by
a curious chance the 2nd and 3rd Battalions
of the Grenadiers were relieved in the line by the
1st and 4th Battalions respectively. The line
occupied by De Crespigny’s and Sergison-Brooke’s
Brigades was taken over by Seymour’s Brigade,
and the 1st Battalion Grenadiers placed all four
Companies in the front trenches.</p>

<p>The attack of the 9th had carried the Guards
Division to its final objective, but the troops on the
right had not been so successful, with the result
that Seymour’s Brigade had taken over a salient
more acute than a right angle, which made the
general plan for a further attack rather awkward.
On the evening of the 11th, <abbr title="Numbers">Nos.</abbr> 3 and 4 Companies
moved up behind the King’s and <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 2 Companies
with two platoons of the 2nd Battalion Scots
Guards, which went to Egypt House. These two
platoons had been specially detailed to get in
<!--290.png--><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260"></a><span class="pageno">260</span>
touch with the 51st Brigade, which had met with
so much opposition that it was unable to advance.
During the night the enemy put down a heavy
gas-shell barrage on the front line, and caused
a large number of casualties. On the 12th a
further attack was commenced, and the British
barrage proved to be irregular and ragged, in
marked contrast to the excellent barrages of
July 31 and October 9. Under this barrage the
1st Battalion moved up to its objective, which
it successfully captured. Lieutenant J. P. Bibby
was killed as he advanced with <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 3 Company,
and there were a good many casualties among
other ranks. Unfortunately the Officer Commanding
the two platoons of Scots Guards was
killed, and Second Lieutenant L. G. Byng was
sent to take his place.</p>

<p>Although the Battalions from the 51st Brigade
reported themselves on their objectives, the contact
patrols which were sent out failed to find any
trace of them. It was afterwards found that this
Brigade had reached its objective, passing over
many Germans in doing so, and had swerved
away too far to the right. Early in the morning
the 1st Battalion reported a field-gun in action
on the edge of the forest a few hundred yards in
front of it. In response to an appeal for assistance,
our artillery applied destructive fire to the
spot indicated, and put down a box barrage to
enable the patrols to go forward and destroy
the gun, but owing to the hostile sniping this
was impossible. On the night of the 12th the
Battalion succeeded in clearing up the situation
on the right, and getting in touch with the 51st
<!--291.png--><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261"></a><span class="pageno">261</span>
Brigade. The following day it was relieved by
De Crespigny’s Brigade, which now took over the
line. During the relief Second Lieutenant R.
Hall-Watt was killed, and Captain Rhodes was
wounded, but remained at duty. The casualties
among other ranks were 36 killed and 200
wounded or missing.</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="sc">The 4th Battalion</span></p>

<p class="p1 sidenote"><abbr title="October">Oct.</abbr> 7-13.</p>

<p class="p1">For two days previous to the 7th, the 4th
Battalion had been working in the trenches in
the front line and carrying up material to the
dumps. On the night of the 6th a large fatigue
party under Lieutenant Nash had worked for six
hours with water and mud up to their waists,
endeavouring to lay mat crossings over the
marsh. The following day Lord Gort took round
representatives of the 1st Guards Brigade, which
was to use these mats during the attack, and
showed them the positions of the bridges which
had been made. Unfortunately in the early
morning many of them had been destroyed, and
Lieutenant Nash was again at work repairing
them and relaying others. On the night of the
7th the 4th Battalion was relieved, and retired
to Dulwich Camp near Bluet Farm. The following
officers took part in the operations from the
9th to the 12th October:</p>

<p>On the 9th Seymour’s Brigade was not called
upon to fight, and after reaching Wood 15
remained in shell-holes and abandoned gun-pits.
Lieutenant Ingleby, the acting Quartermaster,
brought up hot soup in the morning, and bivouac
sheets were given to the men to protect them
from the rain which now came down heavily.
On October 10 the 3rd Brigade was sent up to
take over the whole line, and relieve the other
two Guards Brigades. The 4th Battalion was
to be in the centre, with the 1st Battalion Grenadiers
on the right, the 1st Battalion Welsh
Guards on the left, and the 2nd Battalion Scots
Guards in reserve. <abbr title="Lieutenant">Lieut.</abbr>-Colonel Lord Gort
and <abbr title="Lieutenant">Lieut.</abbr>-Colonel Maitland went up to ascertain
the exact positions their Battalions were to take
up, and as there seemed a good deal of uncertainty
about the position on the right, the Brigade-Major
suggested they should wait until the contact
aeroplane had dropped its report. This
would have entailed some delay, and the Commanding
Officers decided to bring up their
Battalions at once to Vee Bend. In order to
<!--293.png--><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263"></a><span class="pageno">263</span>
ensure the close co-operation of the 1st and 4th
Battalions, it was agreed to have one Headquarters
for both Battalions. On arrival in the
front line, <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 3 Company under Captain Burke,
and <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 2 under Second Lieutenant Pryce, were
placed in the front line with the remainder in
reserve. The relief was arduous, as the ground
was a mass of shell-holes full of water, with
the sides slipping and crumbling. On the 11th
detailed orders for the attacks on the next
day were issued, and the position of the enemy
was carefully studied. In the morning German
aircraft came over flying at 300 feet: the pilots
were clearly visible leaning over the edge of their
fuselages, and dropping Véry lights on to the
trenches to indicate them to their artillery.
They were received with a fusillade of Lewis-gun
and rifle fire, and <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 3 Company succeeded in
bringing one down in flames at the southern end
of Houthulst Forest; but the enemy’s artillery
had received sufficient information to shell the
front trenches with considerable accuracy, and
shells began to fall in large numbers. That night
a good deal of difficulty was experienced in bringing
up the rations, for it was extremely dark
and the mud on the sand-bags made it almost
impossible to distinguish the marking. <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 4
Company under Lieutenant H. H. Sloane-Stanley
were told off for this task, and worked very hard
under great difficulties. Sergeant Billings of
<abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 3 Company, observing an enemy patrol
approaching our lines, ran out and captured the
officer and his orderly, from whom much valuable
information and some maps were secured.</p>

<p><!--294.png--><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264"></a><span class="pageno">264</span>
At 5.25 <span class="sc small">A.M.</span> on October 12 the attack was
launched. The task allotted to Seymour’s
Brigade was small compared with that of the
troops on the right, as the direction of the
advance of the Division was half left. <abbr title="Numbers">Nos.</abbr> 2
and 3 Companies under Second Lieutenant Pryce
and Captain Burke consolidated their positions
on the new objective during the previous night,
although <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 3 Company had to withdraw to its
original line at daybreak, as it was in the direct
line of the creeping barrage. The Welsh Guards
on the left remained stationary while the forward
movement was being made on the right, and
<abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 3 Company of the 4th Battalion had only to
go about 100 yards, so that these units were in
position before zero hour. The object of the
attack was to bring the whole line to within
150 yards of Houthulst Forest. As soon as our
barrage came down, two platoons of <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 3 under
Lieutenant Nash advanced and captured their
objective with comparative ease, while two
platoons from <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 1 Company occupied the old
front line in close support. Not long afterwards
Lieutenant Pryce reported that his two
platoons had also reached their destination. The
whole advance had been attended with but few
casualties, as the enemy offered very little opposition.
While coming up to inspect his two front
platoons, Captain Pixley was killed by snipers,
who had been left behind when the enemy retired
to harass the advance. Any movement immediately
drew the fire of these snipers, and after
some of them had been located and killed it was
easier to move about. About 11.30 <span class="sc small">A.M.</span> the
<!--295.png--><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265"></a><span class="pageno">265</span>
enemy’s barrage died down, and as there were no
signs of any counter-attack, the rest of the day was
spent in consolidating the position and in attending
to the wounded. Two patrols were sent out into
the fringes of Houthulst Forest, and returned with
reports of the enemy’s defences and the condition
of the ground, obtained from some prisoners they
captured. Since it was clear that the enemy knew
the range of the taped tracks, repeated hits having
been registered on it, a party was detailed to lay
out a new course on the 13th. The construction of
this course was fully justified later by the absence
of casualties when the Battalion was relieved.
Including the two days in bivouacs on the east
side of the canal, the Battalion had spent seven
days in the open, exposed to the rain, and lying
on waterlogged ground with little or no shelter.</p>

<p>The total casualties in the Battalion were
20 killed, 4 missing, and 64 wounded. On the
night of the 13th the Battalion was relieved, and
travelled by train from Boesinghe to Ondank
Station, where it went into billets at De Wippe
Corner.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Diary of the War, October, November,

<p class="p2 unindent"><span class="sc">Successful</span> operations were carried out by Field-Marshal
Sir Douglas Haig in front of the Passchendaele
Ridge at the beginning of October,
when a large number of prisoners were captured,
and, in spite of repeated counter-attacks by
the Germans, the British forced their way to
Houthulst Forest. The French made a successful
advance on the Aisne front across the Soissons&mdash;Laon
road, and penetrated the German line in
several places. At the beginning of November the
Germans retreated from the Chemin des Dames,
and were closely followed by the French.</p>

<p>Sir Julian Byng with the Third Army gained
a remarkable victory in the direction of Cambrai,
and penetrated the Siegfried line. Farther advances
were made, until the whole of the Bourlon
Wood fell into the hands of the British, but the
Germans attempted an encircling movement, to
cut off the troops in the salient that had been
created, and forced back the British line at
Gonnelieu and Bourlon. After some very heavy
<!--297.png--><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267"></a><span class="pageno">267</span>
fighting Sir Julian Byng was able to bring up
reinforcements, and restore the line.</p>

<p>In Italy the Austrians, reinforced by some
German divisions, gained a decisive victory over
the Italians, and advanced far into Italy. So
serious was the situation that the Allied War
Council decided to send British and French
Divisions to the aid of the Italians. The Italians
continued to retreat until they reached the Piave,
and at one time Venice seemed threatened, but
eventually the Italian resistance stiffened, and the
Austrian invasion was checked.</p>

<p>In Palestine, after a series of brilliant operations,
General Sir E. Allenby captured Jerusalem.</p>

<p>From Mesopotamia came the sad news of the
death of General Sir Stanley Maude from cholera,
and the appointment of General Sir W. R.
Marshall as his successor.</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="sc">Cambrai and Gouzeaucourt</span></p>

<p class="p1 sidenote"><abbr title="November">Nov.</abbr></p>

<p class="p1">In November Sir Douglas Haig determined
to take advantage of the concentration of the
enemy’s forces on other parts of the line, to
carry out a surprise attack in the direction of
Cambrai, and to penetrate as far as possible into
the German lines, with a view to dislocate one of
the enemy’s nerve centres. In his despatch he
makes it clear that the capture of Cambrai itself
was a secondary consideration, and that his main
object was to secure the right flank of the principal
objective north-east of Bourlon.</p>

<p>Sir Julian Byng, to whom these operations
were entrusted, received instructions to dispense
with artillery preparation, and to depend entirely
<!--298.png--><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268"></a><span class="pageno">268</span>
on the tanks, to cut through the enemy’s wire.
This was an entirely new departure. Hitherto
it had been generally admitted by both sides
that no infantry attack could possibly succeed,
without an artillery preparation and a creeping
barrage, and it remained to be seen whether the
absence of all artillery support would be compensated
for by the tanks, and by the undoubted
advantage of attacking without giving the enemy
any warning. With the utmost secrecy Sir Julian
Byng assembled flotillas of tanks, and hid them
in the woods.</p>

<p>The attack started on November 20, and
succeeded beyond all expectations, for not only
was the Siegfried line pierced to a depth of six
miles, but over 10,000 prisoners and 142 guns
were taken. The capture of Bourlon Wood was
successfully effected, but the Germans soon recovered
from their surprise, and commenced to
bring up reinforcements, with the result that
the Guards Division on attempting a farther
advance on Fontaine found the enemy in great
strength.</p>

<p>The ground that had been gained during the
British advance formed an awkward salient about
ten miles in width and six miles in depth, and
the problem that confronted Sir Douglas Haig
was whether to continue the advance or to withdraw.
After weighing the various considerations
involved, he came to the conclusion that it would
be best to advance. On the enemy’s side the
Germans were at first rather staggered at finding
that their impenetrable Siegfried line had
been pierced, but Ludendorff determined to take
<!--299.png--><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269"></a><span class="pageno">269</span>
advantage of the situation that had been created,
and to strike on each side of the salient with a
view to cutting off the troops in front.</p>

<p>On November 30, after a severe bombardment
with gas shells, the Germans advanced under
cover of the morning mist, and surprised our men
in the trenches. From Bonavis to Gonnelieu,
the Germans pushed through masses of men, and
succeeded in capturing a large number of prisoners,
although their attacks between Mœuvres and the
Scheldt Canal were not so successful. The situation
was extremely critical, and at one time it
seemed that the enemy would succeed in cutting
off all the British troops in the salient. They
would undoubtedly have done so, had it not
been for the gallant stand made by the Twenty-ninth
Division at Masnières. This enabled Sir
Julian Byng to bring up reinforcements, and
the Guards Division was thrown in to stop the
rush. The British troops retook the <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Quentin
Ridge, and entered Gonnelieu and Gauche Wood;
but meanwhile the position at Masnières had
become precarious, and the Twenty-ninth Division
was ordered to withdraw. Although the situation
was saved, Sir Julian Byng saw that he must
either retake Bonavis Ridge, or else withdraw to
the Flesquières line. The latter course was considered
best under the circumstances, and accordingly
the shortening of the line commenced on
December 4.</p>

<p class="p2 center"><i>Divisional Account</i></p>

<p class="p1">After the successful operations in October
the Guards Division had a month’s rest. On
<!--300.png--><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270"></a><span class="pageno">270</span>
November 9 the move southward began, although
the eventual destination was not known, and
many days were spent in long marches. On
the 11th Major-General Feilding was informed
of the proposal to attack Cambrai, but was
warned that the success of the whole operation
depended on its being kept a profound secret.
The Guards Division was to move by easy stages
to that area, marching invariably by night, and
the eventual attack was to depend on the result
of the operations then in progress in Bourlon
Wood. If they were successful, the Guards Division
was to advance on Cambrai, but if not, the
attack was to be altered to a raid on a large
scale. Major-General Feilding confidentially informed
his Brigadiers and Commanding Officers
of the impending attack, but in order that some
ostensible reason might be given for these continual
marches, he told them to announce that
the Division was on its way to relieve the French.
It was, however, necessary to account for the
order to leave the kits behind, as this was generally
associated in the men’s minds with an impending
attack. It was consequently announced
that, on account of the lack of accommodation
in the part of the French line to which the
Division was going, the kits must be stored.
It was generally believed that these orders
were also due to the transfer of large forces to
Italy and the consequent dearth of transport.</p>

<p>It was not until the 23rd that the Guards
Division reached the neighbourhood of Flesquières,
and De Crespigny’s and Seymour’s
Brigades were sent up to relieve two Brigades
<!--301.png--><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271"></a><span class="pageno">271</span>
of the Fifty-first Division. This was a very long
day for the men, involving a march of over fifteen
miles across an unknown country in the dark,
and it was far more difficult to find the way
than it need have been, because the positions of
the Brigade and Divisional Headquarters were
incorrectly given by the Corps Staff. The
cavalry, to be employed in certain eventualities,
stood about in large numbers, and blocked the
road, but eventually the relief was successfully
accomplished. The Divisional front extended
from the south-eastern outskirts of Cantaing to
the north-eastern corner of Bourlon Wood, and
was supported by four Brigades of <abbr title="Royal Field Artillery">R.F.A.</abbr> and
two of Guards Divisional Artillery.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><abbr title="November">Nov.</abbr> 24.</p>

<p>Although the situation remained unchanged
during the 24th, the Fortieth Division, on the
left, had some severe fighting in Bourlon Wood.
The same night General Feilding placed the
2nd Battalion Scots Guards under the orders
of General Ponsonby, commanding the Fortieth
Division, and sent them up to reinforce General
Crozier’s 119th Brigade, which was hard pressed.
This Battalion moved up to the south-east corner
of Bourlon Wood, where it received orders to
clear the wood of the enemy. This attack, which
started at 2 <span class="sc small">P.M.</span>, had the effect of advancing the
line some distance.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><abbr title="November">Nov.</abbr> 25.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the 4th Battalion Grenadiers, which
had taken the place of the 2nd Battalion Scots
Guards, received orders on the 25th to move up
in support of the Fortieth Division. This meant
that it had to advance in full view of the
Germans, who at once put down a heavy barrage
<!--302.png--><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272"></a><span class="pageno">272</span>
in front of it. With the utmost coolness and
steadiness the 4th Battalion advanced through
this barrage as if it was on parade, and earned
special praise from General Ponsonby. Though
the 4th Battalion moved up into close support in
Bourlon Wood, its services were not needed, as the
Fortieth Division had secured all its objectives.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><abbr title="November">Nov.</abbr> 26.</p>

<p>Next day General Feilding held a conference
of Brigadiers, and discussed in detail the plan
of attack on Fontaine, which was to be carried
out by General Sergison-Brooke’s Brigade. The
general scheme did not appear to offer much
prospect of success, since the whole country between
Bourlon Wood and Flesquières was overlooked
by the enemy, whose guns were posted
on the ridges, west of Cambrai, north of Bourlon
Wood, and east of the Canal. The Germans
would therefore be able not only to concentrate
their fire on Fontaine but to sweep the back
areas where our reserves would be massed.
Major-General Feilding had already pointed out
that, unless these ridges were captured, it would
be quite impossible for any troops to remain in
Fontaine. He had only six available Battalions,
and the line was 3800 yards in length, so that it
was expecting a great deal of half a division to
attack a position so strongly held. The Higher
Command, in spite of these weighty arguments,
however, decided to attempt the experiment.
The attack was to be undertaken by the 3rd
Battalion Grenadiers, 1st Battalion Coldstream,
and 2nd Battalion Irish Guards, while the 1st
Battalion Scots Guards was to hold the right
of the line.</p>

<p class="p2 center"><!--303.png--><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273"></a><span class="pageno">273</span>
<span class="sc">Attack on Fontaine</span></p>

<p class="p1 sidenote"><abbr title="November">Nov.</abbr> 27.</p>

<p class="p1">It was 6.20 on the morning of the 27th that
the attack started. As the tanks were late in
crossing the line, the infantry did not wait for
them. Advancing with the 3rd Battalion Grenadiers
on the right, the 1st Battalion Coldstream
in the centre, and the 2nd Battalion Irish Guards
on the left, the force at once came under heavy
machine-gun fire. All the ground on the way
to the first objective&mdash;approximately 1000 yards
off&mdash;was covered with houses, which were practically
untouched by shell-fire, and afforded cover
to the enemy’s machine-guns. Moreover, our
artillery were not allowed to shell Cambrai. But
in spite of innumerable difficulties the three
Battalions went gallantly forward, and captured
the first objective by 8.30 <span class="sc small">A.M.</span></p>

<p>The casualties, however, were very heavy, and
so weakened the attackers, that they had not
enough men properly to “mop up” the houses
in the village and the dug-outs north of it. The
tanks, which had been detailed to move round
the outskirts of Fontaine, were knocked out almost
at once, but one or two that later went through
the village itself were of great assistance in clearing
the streets. Everywhere the enemy were in
large numbers, and though at one time over 1000
prisoners had been taken, only 600 eventually
reached the Divisional cage, owing partly to the
small numbers available for escort, and partly to
the incomplete “mopping-up.” Just the same
difficulty confronted the 2nd Battalion Irish
Guards, which had to go through Bourlon Wood,
<!--304.png--><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274"></a><span class="pageno">274</span>
lost many prisoners in the thick undergrowth,
and on reaching the northern edge of the wood,
came in for a deluge of shells from the enemy’s
artillery.</p>

<p>When General Sergison-Brooke received the
report that the first objective had been secured,
and that the Battalions had been greatly weakened,
he sent word to Lord Gort, in command
of the 4th Battalion Grenadiers, to move forward
in support. One company was to support the
3rd Battalion Grenadiers, and two others the
1st Battalion Coldstream, while the remaining
company was to watch the left flank of the 2nd
Irish Guards. At the same time he asked that
the 1st Welsh Guards from General Seymour’s
Brigade might be lent to him. This was immediately
done.</p>

<p>In the meantime the Germans had developed
very strong counter-attacks against the Irish
Guards in Bourlon Wood, and, finding there was
a gap between that Battalion and the 1st Battalion
Coldstream, endeavoured to drive in a
wedge. In their endeavours to close this gap the
Coldstream only succeeded in creating another
gap between them and the Grenadiers. The
result was that the Irish Guards at the north
edge of Bourlon Wood were completely cut off,
and there seemed every prospect of the 3rd
Battalion Grenadiers in Fontaine and the 1st
Battalion Coldstream on the left being cut off
too. The 3rd Battalion Grenadiers’ casualties
amounted to well over half of its attacking
strength, including nine officers out of twelve
killed and wounded. It was now seen that the
<!--305.png--><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275"></a><span class="pageno">275</span>
enemy had brought up large masses of troops, and
were attacking vigorously on the whole front.
General Sergison-Brooke therefore gave orders
for all three Battalions to withdraw to the line
from which they started.</p>

<p>Such a move was most disappointing to the
men who had reached the first objective, but in
the circumstances there seemed no other alternative.
The enemy continued to throw in more
men, and once more the fighting became very
fierce, but though our depleted Battalions were
unable to maintain their hold on Fontaine, the
enemy found it equally impossible to advance
or make any impression on the line. Under cover
of darkness the 1st Battalion Grenadiers and
the 1st Battalion Welsh Guards took over the
line that evening, and Sergison-Brooke’s Brigade
withdrew to La Justice, while the 4th Battalion
Grenadiers retired to Flesquières.</p>

<p>This was the first real failure the Guards
Division had. In part it was due to the enemy
having masses of men available for the counter-attack,
but there was also a notable lack on our
side of any reinforcements at the critical moment,
which was attributed at the time to the faulty
arrangements of the Corps Staff.</p>

<p>On hearing of the heavy casualties suffered by
the Guards Division, the Twenty-seventh Corps
sent up two Brigades of the Fifty-ninth Division,
but they had a considerable distance to cover,
and there was no hope of their reaching the line
that night. Consequently they were sent to
Ribecourt and Trescault, while De Crespigny’s
Brigade was moved from Ribecourt to Metz.
<!--306.png--><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276"></a><span class="pageno">276</span>
Fortunately, the night of the 27th was fairly
quiet, and these movements were carried out
without much difficulty.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><abbr title="November">Nov.</abbr> 28.</p>

<p>A day without any incident worth recording
followed, and on November 29 the Fifty-ninth
Division took over the whole area. The Guards
Division was disposed as follows: the Divisional
Artillery at Flesquières, the Royal Engineers at
Trescault, De Crespigny’s Brigade at Metz,
Sergison-Brooke’s Brigade at Ribecourt, and
Seymour’s Brigade at Trescault. After a hard
week in the line they were now to rest, and
retire by easy stages to billets.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><abbr title="November">Nov.</abbr> 30.</p>

<p>Suddenly a telegram arrived announcing that
the Germans had broken through our line, and
the whole Division was ordered to be ready to
move at a moment’s notice. Then came a stream
of orders, conveying instructions for different
Brigades to be placed under different Corps, that
followed one another with bewildering rapidity,
only to be countermanded the next moment.
Finally the whole Division was placed under the
Third Corps, and General Feilding motored off
to get instructions.</p>

<p>Information was now received that the enemy
were holding the line Villers Plouich&mdash;Gouzeaucourt,
and as De Crespigny’s Brigade was already
marching on the latter place, orders were sent
to divert Seymour’s Brigade, which was moving
south, and bring it up on the left of De Crespigny’s
forces.</p>

<p>Meanwhile General de Crespigny determined
to ascertain for himself the exact situation in
front of his Brigade, for the roads were all
<!--307.png--><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277"></a><span class="pageno">277</span>
blocked with retiring troops, and all sorts of
rumours had reached him. So off he rode at full
gallop in the direction of the enemy. Having
crossed the open, he came in view of Gouzeaucourt,
and there saw the Germans making preparations
for a farther advance. He quickly
returned to his Brigade, and at once gave orders
to attack. All the four Commanding Officers
had also ridden ahead of their Battalions, to see
for themselves what the ground was like; and
so it came about that this Brigade, which a few
hours before had been resting and preparing to
retire, were now going forward to the attack, as
if they had had plenty of notice. The advance
of De Crespigny’s Brigade in perfect formation
through all the stragglers and despite the general
disaster was a splendid and heartening sight,
which restored confidence to all the army in that
area.</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="sc">Gouzeaucourt</span></p>

<p class="p1">The ground consisted of undulating downs
gradually descending from Gouzeaucourt Wood,
which occupied a commanding position, to the
village of Gouzeaucourt, and thence rising more
steeply towards Gauche Wood and Gonnelieu.
One great disadvantage Major-General Feilding
had to contend with was the total absence of
artillery support. The guns had been left in the
line at Flesquières, and it was impossible for
them to reach the Guards Division until 7 o’clock
that evening. The attack had therefore to be
launched entirely unsupported by artillery, and
had there been any guns there was no Artillery
<!--308.png--><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278"></a><span class="pageno">278</span>
Divisional Commander or Artillery Staff. When
they did eventually come into action, they were
too doubtful about the situation in front to be
of any real assistance.</p>

<p>About noon the head of the Brigade reached
Gouzeaucourt Wood, and as they arrived the
Battalions formed up for attack. The 1st Battalion
Irish Guards were on the left, with their
right on the Metz-Gouzeaucourt road; the
3rd Battalion Coldstream in the centre, with
their left on this road, and the 2nd Battalion
Coldstream on the right; the 2nd Battalion
Grenadiers were in reserve in Gouzeaucourt Wood.
Each Battalion assumed artillery formation, with
two companies in front and two in support, and
was responsible for 500 yards of frontage. There
was no time for written orders, and all instructions
were given by word of mouth.</p>

<p>At 12.30 the attack was launched, and, as soon
as the leading troops appeared on the crest of
the hill, they came under heavy machine-gun
fire. No very striking incident marked the
initial stages of the attack, but when the leading
Battalions came within 1000 yards of Gouzeaucourt
they found a few men of the Royal Engineers
and some remnants of the Twenty-ninth Division
still holding on to a trench. Later on the 20th
Hussars (dismounted) came up on the right of
the 2nd Battalion Coldstream, and prolonged the
line to the right. During the descent of the slope
towards the village, the machine-gun fire became
intense, but it never even checked the attacking
Battalions, who swept on down the hill and up
again to the far side of the village. When they
<!--309.png--><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279"></a><span class="pageno">279</span>
reached the rise immediately east of the village,
the shells from the enemy’s artillery on <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Quentin’s Ridge raked them at very close range,
but in spite of this the whole objective, including
the village, was captured by 1.30 <span class="sc small">P.M.</span></p>

<p>General de Crespigny now found that his left
flank was in the air, but the Cavalry Corps sent
up a regiment to fill the gap, and touch was subsequently
gained with the 4th Battalion Grenadiers
in Seymour’s Brigade. Soon after a cavalry
regiment on the right came into action mounted,
and made a gallant attempt to turn the enemy’s
left flank, but was stopped by wire and machine-gun
fire. The tanks came up on the right, but
directly they were seen by the enemy four of
them were put out of action. With great
promptitude the crews got their Lewis guns out
and joined the 2nd Battalion Coldstream. It
was now beginning to get dark, and the battle
died down. During the day about 100 prisoners
were captured, besides a number of machine-guns,
and many British howitzers were recovered.
Two supply trains were found at Gouzeaucourt
station untouched.</p>

<p>While De Crespigny’s Brigade was taking Gouzeaucourt,
Seymour’s Brigade, which had come
into the field with equal rapidity, was ordered
to prolong the line to the right. But this order
was subsequently cancelled, and they were told
instead to hold the line Gouzeaucourt&mdash;Villers
Plouich. Moving off in artillery formation, they
advanced between Gouzeaucourt Wood and
Havrincourt Wood, and lined the railway line
between Gouzeaucourt and Villers Plouich.</p>

<p><!--310.png--><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280"></a><span class="pageno">280</span>
At this juncture General Feilding received
orders to continue his advance, and attack the
ridge running from Gonnelieu through Gauche
Wood to Villers Hill. To General de Crespigny
he entrusted the attack on Gauche Wood, and
to General Lord Henry Seymour the capture of
Gonnelieu. <abbr title="Lieutenant">Lieut.</abbr>-Colonel the <abbr title="Honorable">Hon.</abbr> Claud Willoughby,
in charge of the tanks, had been kept
at Divisional Headquarters in anticipation of
an attack, and so only verbal orders for their
assembly direct to him were needed. The tanks
were to precede the infantry, while the Divisional
artillery put down a heavy barrage. The Fifty-ninth
Division were assigned to the left, and the
Cavalry Division to the right. The whole attack
was only to take place if the Twentieth Division
failed, and it was not till 2.45 <span class="sc small">A.M.</span> that the
failure was announced.</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="sc">Capture of Gauche Wood</span></p>

<p class="p1 sidenote"><abbr title="December">Dec.</abbr> 1.</p>

<p class="p1">The orders originally sent to the Division were
to attack the line from Gonnelieu to Gauche Wood
(exclusive) but Major-General Feilding quickly
realised that until Gauche Wood was taken, there
was small prospect of success for the attack on
the left. When the cavalry did not appear on
the left, he instructed General de Crespigny to
make Gauche Wood inclusive.</p>

<p>In De Crespigny’s Brigade the 2nd Battalion
Grenadiers and the 3rd Battalion Coldstream
on the right and left respectively started off. But
the tanks which were to have operated on the
right of the Brigade were late, as well as the
<!--311.png--><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281"></a><span class="pageno">281</span>
cavalry that should have joined in the attack.
After waiting ten minutes in vain for the tanks,
<abbr title="Lieutenant">Lieut.</abbr>-Colonel Rasch attacked without them.
The tanks detailed to the left of the Brigade
arrived just in time, and were of the greatest
possible assistance; in fact, it is doubtful
whether the ridge could ever have been taken
without their help. However, the 2nd Battalion
Grenadiers reached the wood without any tanks
to help them, apparently because the enemy’s
machine-guns were aimed too high.</p>

<p>Immediately the wood was reached two
counter-attacks were launched by the enemy,
but a company from the 2nd Battalion Grenadiers,
which had gone out to protect the right flank
of the Battalion, quickly disposed of them.
After much fighting the whole wood was eventually
cleared of the enemy, but the thickness of
the trees gave the enemy’s snipers a good opportunity
of picking off our officers and <abbr title="Non Commissioned Officer">N.C.O.</abbr>’s,
and the casualties among them were very heavy.
When the tanks on the right came up, they were
of little use in the wood, and as they appeared
to attract the enemy’s shells from all sides, they
eventually retired. Although the cavalry on
the right were over an hour late, when they did
arrive they not only reinforced the men in the
wood, but made the right flank of the Brigade
quite secure. There was some difficulty in maintaining
touch between the two Brigades, and a
company of the 1st Battalion Irish Guards at
one time had to be sent up to fill the gap.
During this attack over 300 prisoners were
captured, in addition to 3 field-guns and nearly
<!--312.png--><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282"></a><span class="pageno">282</span>
100 machine-guns, which had been packed, ready
for removal, near the railway-station.</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="sc">Attack on Gonnelieu</span></p>

<p class="p1">Seymour’s Brigade meanwhile attempted the
more difficult task of taking Gonnelieu and
Quentin. There should have been a large number
of tanks to help, but at the last moment only
nine could be procured. Most of these arrived
too late, but one that was working in conjunction
with the Welsh Guards was of great assistance,
and was largely responsible for clearing a trench
held by machine-guns. The 1st Battalion Welsh
Guards on the right and the 4th Battalion
Grenadiers began the advance, but were at once
met by heavy machine-gun fire&mdash;so intense was
it that progress on the right was completely
arrested, until a tank saved the situation.</p>

<p>It seemed almost impossible to take this
village without the aid of artillery, as there were
machine-guns bristling from every building, and
since the Twentieth Division had failed there
appeared to be but small hope of this second
attempt succeeding. Yet so determined and
persistent was the onslaught of the 4th Battalion
Grenadiers that isolated parties managed to
penetrate into the village. But this was not
enough to silence the enemy’s machine-guns, and
soon it became clear that all we could do was to
hold the line 200 yards from the western edge of
the village. On the left of the line two Companies
of the 1st Battalion Grenadiers were sent up to
strengthen that flank.</p>

<p><!--313.png--><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283"></a><span class="pageno">283</span>
That night the position was as follows: the
1st Battalion Welsh Guards was established on
the high ground on the right, in touch with De
Crespigny’s Brigade; the 4th Battalion Grenadiers,
reinforced by two Companies of the 1st
Battalion, held the line west of Gonnelieu, with
its left in touch with the 2nd Battalion Scots
Guards, who were covering Villers Plouich.
Through the failure of the 183rd Brigade to
arrive in time for the relief on the night of
December 1, the men in the front line, who had
had very heavy fighting, were obliged to remain
where they were for another twenty-four hours.
Next day the relief was carried out, and on
the 3rd De Crespigny’s Brigade took over the
line.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><abbr title="December">Dec.</abbr> 5.</p>

<p>Two bombing attacks were made by the
enemy on the front line on the morning of the
5th, and at one time they gained a foothold in
our trenches, but a prompt counter-attack by
the 1st Battalion Irish Guards soon re-established
the line. On that night De Crespigny’s Brigade
was relieved by the 26th Infantry Brigade.</p>

<p>The casualties in the Guards Division between
November 25 and December 5 were:</p>

On December 5 Field-Marshal Sir Douglas
Haig telegraphed:</p>

<p class="blockquote">I desire to congratulate the Guards Division most
warmly on their fine counter-attacks at Gouzeaucourt
and Gonnelieu. The promptness of decision and rapidity
of action displayed by them were successful in dealing
with a difficult situation.</p>

<p><abbr title="Lieutenant">Lieut.</abbr>-General Sir W. Pulteney sent the following
message:</p>

<p class="blockquote">The Corps Commander wishes to express to all ranks
of the Guards Division his high appreciation of the
prompt manner in which they turned out on 30th November,
counter-attacked through a disorganised rabble,
and retook Gouzeaucourt. The very fine attack which
they subsequently carried out against Quentin Ridge
and Gauche Wood, resulting in the capture of these
important positions, was worthy of the highest traditions
of the Guards.</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="sc">The 4th Battalion</span></p>

<p class="p1 sidenote"><abbr title="October">Oct.</abbr><br /><abbr title="November">Nov.</abbr> 9.</p>

<p class="p1">On October 20 the 4th Battalion left the
Houthulst Forest area, and went into billets at Le
Marais, where the men were comfortably housed.
There it remained until November 9, when the
march to the south through Fiefs to Averdoingt
was commenced. On November 2 Captain C. R.
Britten, <abbr title="Lieutenant">Lieut.</abbr> L. R. Abel-Smith, and <abbr title="Lieutenant">Lieut.</abbr>
the <abbr title="Honorable">Hon.</abbr> A. H. L. Hardinge joined. The
village of Averdoingt proved too small for the
whole Battalion, and one Company went to La
Neuville Planquette, while another was billeted
at the Le Haut Barlet Farm.</p>

<p>The transport had been very much reduced,
owing, it was said, to the despatch of British
<!--315.png--><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285"></a><span class="pageno">285</span>
Divisions to Italy, and an order was issued restricting
the officer’s kit to a minimum of 40 <abbr title="pounds">lb.</abbr>,
including the valise. But, as the officers never
saw their kit after November 23, these regulations
made very little difference. Officers and
men lived out in the open, exposed to rain and
frost, without any change of uniform or underclothes.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><abbr title="November">Nov.</abbr> 17.</p>

<p>On the 17th the march was continued through
Ivergny, Bienvilliers-au-Bois to Achiet-le-Petit,
which the Battalion reached on the 20th. There
the news was received that the forward movement
of the British Army had resulted in a considerable
gain of territory, and that the Division was now
to continue the advance. Lord Gort sent for the
Company Commanders, and explained the details
of the operations, which were to take place the
following days, giving a sketch of the part to
be played by the Guards Division. There was
still some distance to go before our men reached
the area of operations, and in order to avoid
aerial observation the advance was continued
by night. The whole Brigade moved in buses
through Bapaume and Le Transloy to Rocquigny,
and reached Baumetz-les-Cambrai on the 23rd.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><abbr title="November">Nov.</abbr> 23.</p>

<p>The march to Flesquières was very trying,
and the whole Brigade had some difficulty in
finding the way in the dark. Owing to the constant
checks and hesitation, which betrayed the
uncertainty of the leaders as to the direction,
there were brief halts, not long enough even to
allow the men to sit down, then sudden rushes
followed again by abrupt halts, and so on for
several hours. As a bridge had been blown up by
the enemy, the 4th Battalion was forced to go some
distance out of its way through Graincourt, which
was within 100 yards of the outpost line. Flesquières
itself was occupied by the 1st Battalion
Grenadiers, and the 4th Battalion was billeted
just outside the village, in a portion of the
famous Hindenburg line, which the Germans had
considered impregnable!</p>

<p>Perfectly drained and dry underfoot, the
trenches were 15 feet wide and 10 feet deep. The
men’s quarters were in dug-outs constructed with
massive wooden beams and reinforced concrete,
and were fitted with tiers of beds. The communication
trenches were perfectly camouflaged with
rabbit-wire and boughs, so strongly staked to
the side that a man with full equipment could
<!--317.png--><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287"></a><span class="pageno">287</span>
safely use the wire as a bridge. The belt of
wire in front of the trenches was 100 yards wide
in places, and seemed untouched by shell-fire.
The effect of the attack by the tanks was clearly
visible, for great rides had been made through
the wire, and a number of bodies crushed out of
all human semblance lay across the tracks, while
groups of dead Germans, killed in the act of
flight, lay scattered about between the trenches
and the village. The trenches were full of German
equipment, abandoned in the panic, and
two valuable periscopic observation sets were
found by the 4th Battalion, and forwarded to
General Headquarters.</p>

<p>The labour entailed in digging this stupendous
work, which may fairly be compared in conception
and execution to the great Chinese Wall, was
clearly beyond the powers of any army actively
engaged, however high might have been its
discipline and capacity for work. But the
problem of how this wonderful result had been
achieved was solved when a notice-board was
discovered on which was printed “For Russian
Prisoners Only.”</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="sc">Bourlon Wood</span></p>

<p class="p1 sidenote"><abbr title="November">Nov.</abbr> 24.</p>

<p class="p1">On the morning of the 24th, a cold, wet day,
with a gale blowing, a warning order arrived,
instructing the 4th Battalion to move to the
neighbourhood of Bourlon Wood. Later this
order was cancelled, and the Battalion was told
to take over from the 2nd Battalion Scots Guards
the position north of Flesquières. It moved into
<!--318.png--><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288"></a><span class="pageno">288</span>
its new position that night, and by midnight the
relief was complete. The Battalion Headquarters
were in a dug-out, cut out of the solid chalk, and
formed a good example of the comfort and luxury
in which the Germans had been living. The
former occupant of this palatial abode had provided
himself with a wardrobe, looking-glass,
and other luxuries, and had actually arranged a
number of flowering shrubs in pots at the entrance
to improve its appearance.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><abbr title="November">Nov.</abbr> 25.</p>

<p>Early next day the 4th Battalion was placed
under the orders of the 119th Infantry Brigade,
and was sent up to relieve the 2nd Battalion
Scots Guards in Bourlon Wood. The Fortieth
Division were engaged in the difficult task of
capturing Bourlon Wood, and both these Battalions
had been lent to Major-General Ponsonby.
While Lord Gort went off to Graincourt to report
to his new Brigadier, Captain Chapman proceeded
with the Intelligence Party to Anneux chapel, to
reconnoitre the position to be occupied by the
Battalion and the route it was to follow.</p>

<p>By now the Germans had begun to recover
from the defeat inflicted on them, and were bringing
up a number of guns to bear on our position.
Bourlon Wood and Anneux chapel were subjected
to a severe shelling, and the 119th Brigade
suffered very heavy casualties. The Intelligence
Party had been ordered by Colonel Benzie, commanding
the forward area round Anneux chapel,
to remain in the sunken roads, and were therefore
protected from shell-fire; but, when they returned
by the road which had been selected for
the 4th Battalion to march by, they came in for
<!--319.png--><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289"></a><span class="pageno">289</span>
a certain amount of shelling and lost 2 men, while
Captain Chapman himself was slightly wounded.
It seemed perfectly clear that, if a small party
could be seen by the enemy from Fontaine, a
whole battalion would necessarily offer a tempting
target to the German artillery. Captain
Chapman therefore decided to alter the route,
and approach Anneux chapel by another road,
leaving Graincourt on the right.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the 4th Battalion, with <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 4 Company
under Captain Paton leading, waited in
the position held on the previous night, south
of La Justice, along the southern edge of the
Graincourt&mdash;Marcoing road, until the Intelligence
Party returned, and then advanced by the new
road that had been chosen. For the first 200 yards
nothing happened, and then suddenly the enemy
put down a heavy barrage across the line of
advance. No doubt he imagined that his barrage
would effectually prevent any troops coming up;
in practice it proved a perfectly useless barrier, for
the Battalion took not the slightest notice of it.
There was about half a mile to be crossed, on
which the shells continually fell, and the Battalion
did not even check its pace.</p>

<p>Assuming artillery formation, it went straight
through the barrage. Spouts of earth sprang up
at the men’s feet as if by magic, and the noise
was deafening, but they plodded on. So steady
was the behaviour of all ranks that General
Ponsonby afterwards issued a special order of
the day, stating that the 4th Battalion had come
up to his support as steadily as if it had been
on parade. It suffered 30 casualties, which, in
<!--320.png--><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290"></a><span class="pageno">290</span>
view of the amount of shell-fire, may be considered
astonishingly light.</p>

<p>The following graphic description of these
two days was written by Captain M. Chapman
in a sketch entitled “Intelligence,” which he
began, but which he never lived to finish.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“On the morning of the &mdash; the Battalion
marched up a long wet <i>pavé</i> road in the direction
of the gun-flashes and the Véry Lights, whilst
the Battalion ‘drums,’ somewhere in the dark,
played the tune that Grenadiers call their own,
and the C.O. in silence watched his men file by.
The test of discipline and training had begun.
The figures of the men looked tall and grim,
magnified by the shadows cast from the shrouded
lanterns of the motor-lorries. The night was
dark, and a driving rain soon soaked the tramping
men. In an hour’s time you could see by
the light of a torch a mist rising from the soaked
and perspiring humanity in front.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“A halt was called and men were detailed to
pick up bivouac-sheets and petrol-tins of water.
The already heavy-laden troops moved on again
more slowly with their increased burden, along
slippery wooden tracks laid across a field of
mud. Another halt. An officer appeared, dripping
with moisture, accompanied by guides who
took charge of the companies and allotted them
their area in which to bivouac.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“To-morrow was zero day, not for the 4th Battalion,
but for some one else. If some one else
failed, then the Grenadiers would have to put
matters straight; that is to say, the Grenadiers
<!--321.png--><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291"></a><span class="pageno">291</span>
were in reserve. The Intelligence Officer gave
one last look at the inky darkness, and going
down on hands and knees crawled into a long,
low-arched dug-out. Sleeping men sprawled
across the floor, while at the farther end a
solitary candle burned. Picking his way across
the recumbent figures he saw the Commanding
Officer lying on his back, his head propped against
a pack, silently smoking a cigarette and thinking.
The Intelligence Officer lay down by his side,
and, watching the Adjutant writing orders and
speaking down a telephone, fell into a fitful sleep.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“Zero hour for some one else left him cold,
unmoved. The accustomed environment of war
and great fatigue dull the sensibility of man.
The steady roar of countless guns was a pleasing
murmur as of rippling water in his sleepy brain.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“A ray of sunlight struggled through the
narrow entrance of the dug-out, and the sleeping
mass of humanity near the door stirred
uneasily. The Intelligence Officer shivered, and,
cautiously rising into a stooping posture, crawled
out into the open air. The sun was trying to
pierce a passage through the heavy ground-mist.
The troops were cooking their breakfast and
beating their chests with a flapping motion to
restore the circulation in their half-frozen limbs.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“On a modern battlefield, lines of wooden
‘duckboards’ run like arteries across the trackless
waste towards the front. Up the arteries flow
fresh men, new blood, human forms complete;
food to support life, ammunition to destroy it.
Down the arteries flow ghosts of what yesterday
were men, with tissues torn, and muscles rent;
<!--322.png--><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292"></a><span class="pageno">292</span>
gibbering prisoners and men who have been
spared to be shattered another day.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“An artery passed the dug-out door. The Intelligence
Officer observed the circulation to and
from the battlefield, and speculated on the fate of
the tide going up, watching the expression on the
faces of the advancing and receding groups. The
men lazily watched the passing tide, exchanging
jokes with friends going either way. Prisoners
alone excited interest, but not sufficient to make
men move more than a few yards from where
they stood.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“French gunners in a wood near by ran hotfoot
to see each band of prisoners pass, but our
men with British phlegm stayed where they
stood, and eyed the foe with casual glance. The
passing wounded drew no expression of pity
from the onlookers, nor did the fate of the ingoing
tide even raise a questioning expression
on their faces. This was the last spot where
selfishness still reigned supreme&mdash;the fringe of
the battle. Death and danger were not sufficiently
close to draw out the best in man; he
behaved as he did in civil life&mdash;each man for
himself and the devil take the hindmost.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“The men who marched up the endless ribbon
to the front looked just like other men, and
anxiety for their own safety left no trace in
their expression. They might have been the
crowd that streams through the factory gates
in the early morning. The outgoing men were
different. They hastened by and looked neither
to the left nor right. They felt that fate had
been too good to them and that it might change
<!--323.png--><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293"></a><span class="pageno">293</span>
its mind and rend them if they loitered by the
way. They had reached the fringe where the
‘Ego’ was whispering in their ears with insistent
voice. They were alive; the others&mdash;they
might be dead&mdash;what matter? They were
alive.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“The wounded stared in front of them, except
those in pain, and the prisoners looked cowed
and miserable. The escorts walked with jaunty
air, rifle slung, bayonets fixed, and exchanged
jokes with all who would pay attention. The
feeling of victory was still in their veins, for the
slouching prisoners spurred their pride of race;
were they not the symbol of all their friends ‘up
there’ had done?</p>

<p class="blockquote">“The stretcher-bearers, intent on their work,
passed the fringe of selfishness untouched. The
bond of pain and suffering held them fast in
unselfishness until the moment when they delivered
their charge to the clearing-station in
the rear. While other men hurried from the
battlefield, these slowly and with aching arms
and legs carried their burdens carefully. Human
suffering must touch some special chord of self-sacrifice
in man. Duty, discipline, and other
self-taught virtues would never produce that
careful studied plod of the stretcher-bearer under
heavy shell-fire, or those deliberate halts to attend
to their patients’ needs.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“Thus the second day passed. The Grenadiers
were not called upon, but sat in the pit and
watched the puppets moving on and off the stage.
The Intelligence Officer had the critic’s box and
made his notes. The night passed quietly and
<!--324.png--><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294"></a><span class="pageno">294</span>
slowly, the news filtered back that our friends
in front had taken all their objectives and that
all went well. The morning brought the fateful
news that the 4th Battalion was under orders to
take over the front line that night, and afterwards
to attack. Every one was busy, even the
Intelligence Officer, and the passing puppets
moved unnoticed. The 4th Battalion prepared
to leave the pit and occupy the stage.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“The third day passed quickly in preparation.
At 4.30 in the afternoon the first platoon stepped
on to the wooden pathway and moved up towards
the front. The Intelligence Officer started last,
with Battalion Headquarters, while the Commanding
Officer and Adjutant and orderlies
plodded off alone. The sun had set and it was
growing dark. That ribbon of wood which led
to the unknown had its advantages, for it gave
a hard, though slippery, foothold; but, once
you stepped upon it, you became its slave. The
Path began to assume a sinister character, when
ahead you saw it lead into a wood full of bursting
shells. Then it took the form of an endless moving
staircase, surely leading to destruction. The
serpent of men moved into such a wood. The
very name it bore was ominous. No one spoke.
The Intelligence Officer noticed his throat was
very dry. His heart pumped at the scream of
each arriving shell. He continued to move
forward as in a dream. At intervals he made
way for stretcher cases. The flash of the bursting
shells disclosed a row of gun-emplacements.
Two gunners pinned under an overturned carriage
screamed.</p>

<p class="blockquote"><!--325.png--><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295"></a><span class="pageno">295</span>
“Still Battalion Headquarters moved on&mdash;out
of the wood into the open&mdash;away from death to
what seemed like security. An odd shell or two
burst near the path, while others shrieked their
way overhead, dealing death somewhere behind.
The mind neglected the latter, focussing all
attention on the former. The pathway crossed
two streams. By now the darkness was complete.
A snorting, sobbing noise came from somewhere
in front, succeeded by a splashing sound. The
path went by a dark and slimy pool, in which
the head and ears of a bogged horse waggled this
way and that pathetically. Then all was still.
A man’s figure could be dimly seen attempting
to cut off the pack saddle before it was buried in
the slough.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“The wooden track abruptly ended. A white
tape feebly glimmered in the dark, hanging
loosely between upright iron stakes, rifles driven
muzzle down into the sodden soil, and portions
of broken branches.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“The Intelligence Officer seized the tape and
floundered slowly on. The men behind him
breathed heavily, and in quiet tones cursed the
water and the mud, the tape and the hand that
laid it. Some one tripped. A halt was called.
The obstruction proved to be a comrade, some
flotsam from the men ahead. He was alive,
warm, but inarticulate. A sergeant felt him
over in the dark. Some one said, ‘My Gawd,
Sir, ’e’s got it through the throat.’ The Intelligence
Officer spoke words of promise to the man
and left him there. ‘Outgoing troops would
pick him up,’ and other well-worn words of
<!--326.png--><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296"></a><span class="pageno">296</span>
comfort, although he knew they might not see
him. He felt he was leaving him to die. This
is war.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“The tape suddenly ended. Heaps of broken
stone disclosed the close proximity of a concrete
dug-out. A guide cautiously felt his way into
the darkness and presently led the Intelligence
Officer down some steps below the ground. At
the foot of the steps hung a soaking blanket,
behind which a light glimmered feebly. The
Intelligence Officer cautiously pulled the blanket
to one side, and blinked at the group inside. Two
Commanding Officers and two Adjutants were
talking. ‘Handing over’ was in process. The
outgoing were clearly anxious to be gone; the
incoming were anxious not to let them go without
knowing what lay before them.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“A succession of officers and orderlies peered
through the doorway, saluted and uttered the
magic words, ‘Relief complete, Sir,’ and vanished
into the outer darkness. Their strained
expressions did not belie the full meaning of the
sentence. The outgoing C.O. pushing back his
chair with a scraping noise said, with a half-apologetic
air, he would be off, and he and his
satellites vanished. He had laid down his
burden; the 4th Battalion had assumed it. His
footsteps sounded light and care-free as they
died away.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“All that night officers and men groped their
way through mud and filth, visiting outposts,
distributing rations, each bent on a mission
involving the safety and comfort of the other.
The Intelligence Officer felt that the atmosphere
<!--327.png--><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297"></a><span class="pageno">297</span>
had changed. The Commanding Officer could
have reclined on the German bed in the dug-out,
his feet out of the six inches of liquid slush.
Actually he spent his time going round the line,
four hours of intense physical strain. Shells and
bullets do not sound more pleasant because it
is dark.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“The Transport Officer might have dumped
the rations beyond the barrage and returned to
the security of the horse-lines, and the warmth
of his valise. As a matter of fact, he led his
struggling animals up a broken, shattered road,
through the barrage, round the trunks of fallen
trees, and delivered his consignment at <abbr title="Brigade Headquarters">B.H.Q.</abbr>
The Adjutant might have said with reason that
the ration parties had lost their way, that conditions
were impossible, but the Intelligence
Officer watched him supervise everything in
person&mdash;in the open. Before dawn the front
line was rationed&mdash;every post established, no
chances taken. The Intelligence Officer saw it
all and said: ‘If this is war, some parts of it at
least are good.’</p>

<p class="blockquote">“At dawn the next morning he arose and stood
shivering in the cold mist. He visited his observation-post,
and, watching trenches through
his telescope as the sun slowly made its way
through the haze, he smiled as he recognised
well-known <abbr title="Non Commissioned Officer">N.C.O.</abbr>’s and men moving about in
the nonchalant manner which all assume before
the sniper starts his work, and when tired
gunners take their rest. He knew that later
he might search for hours and find no movement;
all would be hiding in their shell-hole lairs.</p>

<p class="blockquote"><!--328.png--><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298"></a><span class="pageno">298</span>
“A distant hum reminding him of some gigantic
insect, drew his attention from his work, and
two aeroplanes appeared, flying very low. In
a few minutes the moving figures vanished
from the field of view of his telescope. The
earth swallowed them up. Then commenced
manœuvres that reminded him of sparrow-hawks
quartering their haunting ground for prey. The
droning insects flew back and forth. No movement
was visible on the ground. A hooded head
looked over the fuselage of each machine. The
Iron Cross showed clearly on the wings. Then
warning lights were dropped from each machine.
Each light marked the position of a trench and
seemed to say, ‘Eat, drink, and be merry, for
soon you will die.’ The whole proceeding revolted
the men watching from the <abbr title="Observation Post">O.P.</abbr> They
knew the full intent of it. Their imagination
heard the scream of the shells which would surely
fall where the lights had dropped. They felt for
their friends out there. Discovered by their
enemies, the hiding men used their weapons
viciously. The rattle of machine-guns and rifles
was mixed with the drone of the aeroplanes.
The pilots knew their work was done. They
turned to fly. One of them staggered in his
course. The Intelligence Officer watched the
machine crash in flames in a distant forest. The
hiding men in their shell-holes sat down to wait
for the punishment that they knew must come.
The Intelligence men watched great spouts of
earth rise skywards and listened to the rending
crash that came slowly across the intervening
space. They longed to help; instead they noted
<!--329.png--><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299"></a><span class="pageno">299</span>
the time and place and entered the information
in their Intelligence report.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“Zero was set for 5 <span class="sc small">A.M.</span>, this time a zero that
concerned the 4th Battalion alone. The Commanding
Officer and the Intelligence Officer
moved forward through the darkness to an
advanced position at three o’clock in the morning.
Here the nerve centre of the 4th Battalion
was established. Here would enter the news of
battle. The Intelligence Officer established himself
in a corner of the new dug-out. His carrier-pigeons
made little noises to themselves, while
the telephone operators tested and re-tested their
lines. The Intelligence Officer’s hand kept
wandering to his watch. The Commanding
Officer snored. His plans had been truly laid;
interference now would be fatal. He was a
well-trained soldier, and he slept.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“Five minutes before zero the Intelligence
Officer woke the Commanding Officer, and both
waited for the well-known throb of innumerable
guns. One of them at least thought of his
friends waiting to follow up the moving death.
What were those others, his enemies, doing?
Did they realise what hell would break upon
them? Did they suspect the impending stroke?</p>

<p class="blockquote">“The blow fell to the minute. The dug-out
rocked. A sheet of flame lit up the sky. A
thousand devils seemed to be forging a red-hot
band on the earth as far as the eye could see.
Their countless hammer-strokes were merged
into one loud growling, rumbling noise. Gradually
the ear became accustomed to the sound and
detected the sharp crack of answering bullets
<!--330.png--><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300"></a><span class="pageno">300</span>
and the rattle of machine-gun fire. Dawn was
breaking and eyes were strained to pierce the
half-light. Minutes seemed like hours.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“The first messenger arrived at the nerve
centre. He brought good news. Others followed.
All reported success. The Intelligence Officer took
out one of his pigeons, attached a message to its
leg, and released it. He noticed how clumsy his
handling of the bird had become. The pigeon
circled once and flew straight as an arrow in the
right direction. This was dramatic, exciting,
the cream of war. Then came the sordid side.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“The enemy artillery awoke. Great shells
came hurtling through the sky.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“The shelling grew less. The machine-gun
fire died away. The enemy was accepting the
new situation. We had won; he had lost. Both
sides prepared to settle down where they found
themselves, too tired to prolong the struggle.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“The Commanding Officer was satisfied with
the position. Emerging cautiously from its
shelter, the party moved back to the original
Battalion Headquarters. As they passed the
trenches and the scooped-out holes in which the
supports sheltered, inquiries were made as to
casualties, and brave words spoken to cheer the
exhausted men. The Intelligence Officer, ruminating
on death, saw many signs of it. The true
value of the body in which for a short period
resides the soul of man was brought home to
him. Three men crouched in a trench. Two
were cooking; some conversation was in progress.
The third man sat by their side and took no part.
He seemed by his attitude to be thinking deeply,
<!--331.png--><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301"></a><span class="pageno">301</span>
immersed in the solution of a problem. His
face was turned away. The attitude was one
of puzzled thought.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“The Intelligence Officer made inquiries as to
how they had fared. Two of the men looked
up; they gave him a friendly smile and told
him all they knew. The other sat with his head
bent, still studying that inscrutable problem.
The Intelligence Officer noticed with a start the
colour of his ears, how wax-like in appearance;
then he knew in a flash&mdash;the man was dead.
His comrades did not even explain the fact.
They seemed to realise that the figure by their
side no longer counted, that the soul and personality
were fled, that there was nothing dreadful
in the husk that sat there and still seemed one
of them. War had taught them what a small
thing the body really is, what a matter of indifference
whether it is smashed or not. They
had learned one thing at least&mdash;the proportionate
value of the body and the soul.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“That night the 4th Battalion handed over
its burden to some one else. It was due to be
relieved. The Chaplain had arrived to see to it
that the brave dead had decent burial. When it
was possible, the Grenadiers always carried down
their dead, so that in the future, grouped together,
they would stand as a memorial of the cause
they fought for, and indicate plainly to future
generations how Grenadiers could fight and die&mdash;a
monument to the power of discipline, self-sacrifice,
and pride of race.”</p>

<p><!--332.png--><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302"></a><span class="pageno">302</span>
<abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 1 Company under Captain Sloane-Stanley,
<abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 3 under Lieutenant Nash, and <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 4 under
Captain Paton, dug themselves in with entrenching
tools along the Anneux chapel&mdash;Mœuvres
road, while <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 2, under Captain Britten, was
placed in Anneux chapel itself. The shelling
was very violent, and all the roads, by which
supplies and supports had to move, were accurately
and persistently shelled. The Brigadier,
Lord Henry Seymour, came along, quite unconcerned
and not even wearing a helmet, to see
how these companies were getting on, and told
them they might have to move up later into
Bourlon Wood. When it got dark snow began
to fall, and it became bitterly cold. The position
of a lent battalion is by no means an enviable
one, and soon orders and counter-orders from
different authorities succeeded each other with
amazing rapidity. Finally definite orders were
sent to the Battalion to take up a position in
Bourlon Wood, and at the same time it was
placed under the orders of the 186th Brigade.
While this move was being carried out, Lieutenant
Nash was wounded in the leg and sent back to
the dressing-station. In order to keep in touch
with the 186th Brigade, Second Lieutenant Tuckwell
was sent to Graincourt to act as liaison-officer
to General Bradford, V.C.</p>

<p>Bourlon Wood, which covers about 100 acres,
might well have been a typical English covert,
with its tall trees interspersed with undergrowth
about eight feet high. The line to be held consisted
of a road running north and south, parallel
to the front line. The ground was soaking wet, and
<!--333.png--><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303"></a><span class="pageno">303</span>
the men had to force their way through the
dripping leaves and lie out in the wood with no
protection of any kind. Digging through the
stubborn soil and soaking undergrowth was no
easy matter with light entrenching tools, but
they soon produced some sort of cover. The
Fortieth Division, however, had succeeded in its
attack, and so there was nothing for the 4th
Battalion to do but to remain in the wood where
it was. In the evening, much to the satisfaction
of every one, it reverted to the command of the
Guards Division. Lieutenant Ingleby, the acting
Quartermaster, arrived at Battalion Headquarters
at 11 that night, having guided the transport up
to Anneux chapel through intense shelling, and
reported that Second Lieutenant N. A. Pearce,
the transport officer, who had shown great determination
and pluck in his efforts to bring all that
was wanted up to the men in the trenches, had
been killed by a shell. Major-General Feilding
received the following message from Major-General
Ponsonby:</p>

<p class="blockquote">I wish to express on behalf of my Division my sincere
thanks for the support given us on the 24th and 25th
by the Battalions of the Guards Division placed at my
disposal for the defence of Bourlon Wood, namely the
2nd Battalion Scots Guards and 4th Battalion Grenadier
Guards.</p>

<p class="blockquote">I should like to bring to your notice particularly the
2nd Battalion Scots Guards, who throughout the period
prevented the enemy from breaking through the right
flank of the position, and assisted in repelling at least
two of the enemy’s counter-attacks. I enclose extracts
from the report of the Brigadier-General commanding
the 119th Infantry Brigade:</p>

<p class="blockquote"><!--334.png--><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304"></a><span class="pageno">304</span>
“The 2nd Battalion Scots Guards reinforced the
firing line, which had become very thin, early in the
morning of November 25, and remained in action until
they came under the orders of the 186th Infantry
Brigade on the night of 26-27th November. All ranks
behaved with the utmost gallantry, and assisted to
repel at least two German counter-attacks in addition
to continual enemy pressure. They inspired all with
great confidence.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“The 4th Battalion Grenadier Guards came under
my command in the afternoon of the 25th <abbr title="instant">inst.</abbr> To
reach a position of readiness it had to cross the open in
artillery formation for a great distance under enemy
observation, and were heavily shelled in so doing. The
men were as steady as if on parade. To the above-mentioned
units I wish to express my gratitude.”</p>

<p class="sidenote"><abbr title="November">Nov.</abbr> 26.</p>

<p>The next day passed quietly, and the company
commanders were able to go in turn to Battalion
Headquarters to have some rest. In the evening
snow fell heavily, and the men had a cold and
uncomfortable night. The 4th Battalion was
again to be lent to another brigade, that of
General Sergison-Brooke, who received orders
to attack Fontaine. It was not actually wanted
for the attack, but merely to form a defensive
line, on which the assaulting waves could fall
back in case of failure.</p>

<p>The enemy put down a heavy barrage on the
whole line that night, and Lord Gort sent Captain
Chapman to inquire from the 2nd Battalion Irish
Guards what was happening, but it proved to be
merely the outcome of nervousness on the part
of the Germans, and no attack developed. The
Battalion moved off at 5.30 <span class="sc small">A.M.</span>, to take up
new positions facing east instead of north, at very
<!--335.png--><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305"></a><span class="pageno">305</span>
short notice; and, as the night was very dark and
wet and the enemy was so close, the advance
into position required some care. In order to
prevent any confusion in the jumping-off line,
the Battalion was told to occupy a position immediately
in rear of the line, and to move up in the
line only when the attack had actually started.</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="sc">Attack on Fontaine</span></p>

<p class="p1 sidenote"><abbr title="November">Nov.</abbr> 27.</p>

<p class="p1">In a drizzle of rain, and under an intense
enemy barrage, the attack of Sergison-Brooke’s
Brigade started at 6.30 in the morning of the
27th. It reached its objective, but the cost was
so great, that the survivors found it impossible to
maintain the position they had so dearly gained,
without reinforcements. So weak were the
attacking battalions, that they were in danger
of being overwhelmed by counter-attacks. While
the 4th Battalion was waiting for orders about
10 <span class="sc small">A.M.</span>, the German counter-attacks began to
develop, and fire from the left became very
heavy. <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 2 Company under Captain Britten
was sent off to secure the left flank of the Division,
which seemed to be in a dangerously weak
condition. As they came up Second Lieutenant
Windeler was killed by a sniper, and Captain
Britten himself was wounded in the arm by a
rifle bullet. Soon afterwards Second Lieutenant
Oliver, who was now in command of <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 3
Company, was severely wounded in the chest,
arm, and foot, while going out to bring in a
wounded Irish Guardsman. The casualties
among other ranks were proportionately heavy.</p>

<p><!--336.png--><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306"></a><span class="pageno">306</span>
A warning order arrived from Brigadier-General
Sergison-Brooke at 10.30 <span class="sc small">A.M.</span>, preparing
the Battalion to supply two companies for the
support of the 3rd Battalion Grenadiers and
1st Battalion Coldstream, but it seemed doubtful
whether a couple of companies, or even four,
would be of any use in the circumstances. Captain
Gerard, the Adjutant, reported that he had
heard from Captain Paton that already the 2nd
Guards Brigade was falling back to the original
line.</p>

<p>Lord Gort went off at once with Captain
Chapman to the headquarters of the 3rd Battalion,
and discussed the new situation with
Colonel Thorne. They decided that it would
be inadvisable, in view of the enemy’s strength,
and the absence of any appreciable reserves on
our side, to renew the attack, and so use up
the 4th Battalion with small chance of success.
Orders were accordingly issued for the original
line now held by the 4th Battalion to become
the line of resistance, under the command of
Captain Paton and Captain Sloane-Stanley. That
night the 4th Battalion was relieved, and returned
to the Hindenburg line at Flesquières.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><abbr title="November">Nov.</abbr> 28.</p>

<p>On the 28th it marched to Trescault, and
pitched a camp on the open ground between
the Trescault&mdash;Metz road and Havrincourt Wood.
The enemy’s aircraft left them no peace, and
so the tents were struck the next morning, and
pitched again in Havrincourt Wood. The undergrowth
was thick, and the cutting of it took
some time, but when the camp was finished it
proved snug and sheltered.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><abbr title="November">Nov.</abbr> 30.</p>

<p>The officers had just finished breakfast on the
30th, and were about to inspect their companies,
when the news arrived that the Germans had
broken through the line near Gonnelieu. It was
said that the enemy had been seen marching
in fours through Gouzeaucourt. Immediately
orders were given for the Battalion to be ready
to start at a moment’s notice. Although the
men had expected a quiet day, and were quite
unprepared, so perfect were the organisation and
discipline that in half an hour’s time the Battalion
was ready to move off.</p>

<p>Lord Gort’s orders were to concentrate on
Metz, and accordingly the Battalion moved off
in that direction. The road was full of transport
moving in the opposite direction, and with it
ran a stream of men looking strangely unlike
British soldiers, with no rifles or equipment&mdash;wounded
and unwounded with incoherent stories,
officers half-undressed, gunners with breechblocks
in their hands, all with a hunted look.
Some high-explosive shells came streaming over,
and pitched not far from the road. Lord Henry
Seymour with his commanding officers rode on
ahead to try and glean some information, while
the four battalions of his Brigade marched
through Metz, past the beetroot factory and on
to the open ground beyond, where they lay down
and waited.</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="sc">Attack on Gonnelieu</span></p>

<p class="p1">About 2.30 <span class="sc small">P.M.</span> the whole Brigade, in artillery
formation, moved off in the direction of Gouzeaucourt,
and in the meantime the attack of De
<!--340.png--><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308"></a><span class="pageno">308</span>
Crespigny’s Brigade had been completely successful
and required no reinforcements. The direction
of the march was consequently slightly
changed. The 4th Battalion crossed the Trescault&mdash;Gouzeaucourt
road, where, thanks to
Lieutenant Ingleby, the cookers arrived, and the
men were provided with hot food. That night
General Walker, commanding the 16th Brigade
of the Sixth Division, held a conference at the
4th Battalion Headquarters. His object was to
ensure that the 4th Battalion understood his
scheme of attack, for if his brigade failed it
would have to carry out his plan. The hurried
manner in which the attack was planned, and
the obviously scanty information on which the
plan was based, seemed to indicate that it was
not likely to succeed. At 1 <span class="sc small">A.M.</span> a warning
order was issued to the effect that Seymour’s
Brigade would assault Gonnelieu, if the attack
of the 16th Brigade failed. Lord Gort thereupon
wrote out his orders with the very meagre
information at his disposal.</p>

<p>To have to select a definite objective after
dark made things very difficult, since the final
disposition depended upon the attack of the
16th Brigade, and whatever happened an indefinite
front line would be the result. If the
16th Brigade succeeded, Seymour’s Brigade would
simply relieve it, but if it failed the attack would
have to be attempted a second time. These
considerations alone made it necessary to work
out alternative schemes. Lord Henry Seymour
fortunately prepared a detailed plan for the
worst event, and fully realised that his Brigade
<!--341.png--><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309"></a><span class="pageno">309</span>
was to be employed in a manner generally
accepted as impossible, except in a great emergency,
involving the advance of infantry, unsupported
by artillery, across the open against
an enemy occupying trenches, and houses
bristling with machine-guns.</p>

<p>When the news of the failure of the 16th
Brigade’s attack reached Lord Gort, he at once
started off with the Battalion, and crossed the
Villers Plouich road. On reaching the railway
the companies extended, and dug themselves in.
There they waited in the dark for zero hour.</p>

<p>The order of battle for Seymour’s Brigade
was as follows: The 1st Battalion Welsh Guards
on the right and the 4th Battalion Grenadiers on
the left were to undertake the attack. The
1st Battalion Grenadiers was in support on the
<!--342.png--><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310"></a><span class="pageno">310</span>
left, and had to protect the left flank as the
attack advanced, while the 2nd Battalion Scots
Guards had already occupied the high ground
about Villers Plouich. In the 4th Battalion <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr>
2 Company under Second Lieutenant Hubbard
on the right and <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 3 under Captain Burke on
the left formed the first line. <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 4 Company
under Captain Paton was in support, and <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 1
under Captain Sloane-Stanley formed the reserve.
Captain Chapman was sent forward to establish
a forward Battalion Headquarters.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><abbr title="December">Dec.</abbr> 1.</p>

<p>Without any artillery preparation the attack
started at 6.30 <span class="sc small">A.M.</span> It was still fairly dark,
but the Germans could see enough to use their
machine-guns with considerable accuracy. The
line of advance was over open ground, up a
gentle slope leading to Gonnelieu, and there was
no cover or protection of any kind for the attackers.
On came the leading companies of the
4th Battalion in perfect order. The men never
wavered for an instant, though they knew that
they were to be sacrificed to save the situation.
They all understood that the rules of modern
warfare were to be defied, and that instead of
following a creeping barrage they were to advance
across the open, with not even a preliminary
bombardment. Though they knew this, they
never faltered.</p>

<p>The enemy’s machine-gun fire when it broke
over them was terrible, like a driving hailstorm,
but the pace was never checked for a moment.
Especially on the right the fire was terrific, and
<abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 2 Company, which had gone rather too far
in that direction, suffered heavy losses: one
<!--343.png--><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311"></a><span class="pageno">311</span>
platoon was practically wiped out. Second
Lieutenant Hubbard himself was killed, and
Second Lieutenant Denman was mortally
wounded, gallantly attempting to silence a German
machine-gun, while Second Lieutenant
Horne was also wounded. <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 3 Company
under Captain Burke maintained its direction,
and had few casualties until it came up close to
the village. On reaching a road running in the
direction of Vacquerie, it had to pause for a
moment to allow <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 4 to come up before continuing
its advance. Second Lieutenant Veitch
had his thigh smashed by a bullet, and fell back
into a shell-hole. Almost simultaneously a man
shot through the head fell on the top of him, and
being too weak to move the dying man, for
twelve hours he remained in this cramped
position.</p>

<p>The left of the line met with less resistance
than the right, and so got far in advance. <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 3
Company dashed forward into the outskirts of
Gonnelieu, but the village seemed almost impregnable
against infantry unsupported by tanks
or artillery. A small enclosure sheltered by
ruined buildings was the only protected spot,
the ground all round it was swept by machine-gun
fire, and of course the shrubs and rank grass
were no cover at all. Captain Burke dashed in
on the left, and penetrated into the eastern outskirts
of Gonnelieu, while Lieutenant Hardinge
with a few men got round to the north of the
village, and brought up a Lewis gun to a position
in the cemetery. This had a most disconcerting
effect on the enemy, for it threatened his right
<!--344.png--><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312"></a><span class="pageno">312</span>
flank, and enfiladed the troops opposing <abbr title="Numbers">Nos.</abbr> 2
and 4 Companies.</p>

<p>The Germans quickly grasped the fact that
this movement on Lieutenant Hardinge’s part
required immediate action. They managed to
press back the troops on the left of the Brigade,
with a view of enfilading the cemetery. With
great ingenuity they worked round with their
machine-guns, and soon Lieutenant Hardinge’s
position became untenable. All his men were
killed or wounded with the exception of Sergeant
Hull. Then the gun jammed. There was now
nothing to be done but to get back as best he
could, and being luckily only slightly wounded,
he was able to make his way back, accompanied
by Sergeant H. Hull.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Lieutenant L. Abel-Smith and Sergeant
Williams went down a line of huts to the
right, to see if an advance could be made in that
direction, but were met with a withering fire
from the right flank. With two platoons they
therefore advanced a short distance down the
centre of the village, but the enemy’s machine-gun
fire was so fierce that the ground over which
they crawled was plastered with bullets. Some
men, who were creeping along behind a wall, were
killed by bullets which pierced the brickwork, and
Lieutenant L. Abel-Smith himself was wounded.</p>

<p>This most gallant attempt on the part of
<abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 3 Company to capture the village resulted
in such heavy losses that it was obvious it would
have to retire. A German counter-attack as it
was attempting to consolidate its position settled
the matter. A certain number of men managed
<!--345.png--><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313"></a><span class="pageno">313</span>
to get back, but most of them were killed or
taken prisoners, including Captain Burke himself,
who died fighting to the last. The same fate
befell Second Lieutenant Chitty, who, with a
party of <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 1 Company, had succeeded in
entering the village.</p>

<p>Captain Paton with <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 4 Company had the
difficult task of deciding what he should do, on
reaching the trench in front of Gonnelieu. <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 3
had gone on into the outskirts, and there was no
sign of the Welsh Guards on his right. It was
obvious that his best plan would be to hold the
trench until the others came up into line, so that
at least those who had gone on would have a
strong supporting line to retire to. But there
was a mixed medley of men on his left, who
seemed to be wavering in the face of the counter-attack.
Captain Paton thereupon leaped out
of his trench, and ran across the open, with
machine-gun bullets ploughing up the ground
all round him. With almost reckless bravery
he went from trench to trench in full sight of
the German machine-gunners, encouraging these
groups of men from various regiments. At first
he seemed to have almost a charmed life, and
his splendid example inspirited all who saw him.
The situation was saved, and he fell soon afterwards
mortally wounded. For this conspicuous
act of gallantry he was posthumously awarded
the Victoria Cross. Captain Gerard, the Adjutant,
who came up to obtain information for Lord Gort,
found that owing to Captain Paton’s efforts the
left flank was secure.</p>

<p>It was now clear that without considerable
<!--346.png--><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314"></a><span class="pageno">314</span>
reinforcements and unlimited sacrifices the village
could not be taken. The enemy’s machine-guns
were too strong. The Germans were counter-attacking,
and were able to overpower any parties
that had gained a footing in the village. Only one
of the fourteen tanks that had been expected
appeared, and, although it was undoubtedly a
great help to the Welsh Guards, it was quite inadequate
by itself. The Brigade on the left and
the Welsh Guards on the right had been held up,
so that even had the Battalion taken the village
they would not have been able to hold it. A
German officer captured that day stated that his
battalion had attacked from behind Gonnelieu
at 6 <span class="sc small">A.M.</span>, and as our attack started at 6.30 they
had been completely disorganised by our advance,
which they imagined was a counter-attack
delivered with amazing rapidity.</p>

<p>Captain Sloane-Stanley, who had come up
with <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 1 Company, determined to consolidate
the trench immediately in front of Gonnelieu,
so that it might be held with what remained of
the attacking Companies. Lieutenant Irby of the
same Company held a block in the trench against
persistent bombing attacks, and eventually
knocked out a German machine-gun by counter-bombing.
Lord Gort himself now came up to
see exactly how matters stood, and walked about,
as he always did on such occasions, with an
absolute disregard for all danger. It was not long,
however, before he was severely wounded; the
only wonder was that he had not been hit before.
There were many acts of individual bravery,
and perhaps the gallantry displayed by Sergeants
<!--347.png--><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315"></a><span class="pageno">315</span>
Canham and Buckle was one of the most conspicuous.
At one time, when the enemy were
advancing dangerously near our line, these two
sergeants left their trench, and charged. The
Germans, imagining that these two wore only
the foremost of a large party, fled in confusion.</p>

<p>Major Pilcher, who now assumed command
of the 4th Battalion, was confronted with a very
difficult situation. The sadly depleted ranks of
the Battalion were holding the trench in front of
Gonnelieu, and there were only three officers left&mdash;Captain
H. Sloane-Stanley, Lieutenant Layton,
and Lieutenant Irby. The tactical position was
hazardous in the extreme, for both flanks were
in the air and dangerously large gaps in the line
seemed to invite a German attack. When the
troops on the left retired, Major Pilcher called
on the 1st Battalion Grenadiers to send up one
Company to his assistance, and Captain Rhodes
was sent to form a defensive flank. Later, when
further assistance was required, two more Companies
under Captain Spence and Captain Lawford
advanced down the sunken road, and prolonged
the line to the left. This timely assistance
undoubtedly saved the left flank of the 4th Battalion,
and enabled it to maintain its position.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><abbr title="December">Dec.</abbr> 3.</p>

<p>The line now formed a salient in front of
Gonnelieu; the apex being held by the 4th
Battalion with some men of the Northants
Labour Battalion. On the left was the 1st
Battalion Grenadiers, which formed a defensive
flank, while the Welsh Guards écheloned back
to the right. This position was maintained until
December 3, when the 4th Battalion was relieved
<!--348.png--><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316"></a><span class="pageno">316</span>
by the 2nd Battalion Scots Guards, which
latter had been due the night before. Owing
to the delay the already exhausted officers and
men had to spend a further twenty-four hours in
the trenches, exposed to a hard frost. It was only
through almost superhuman efforts that they
received their rations on the morning of the
2nd, as the failure to relieve them had upset
all arrangements for supply.</p>

<p>On the night of the 3rd they marched back,
and bivouacked in the open on some ground
north of Gouzeaucourt Wood, where they remained
ready, in case their services should be
required.</p>

<p>When the Guards Division left the area of
operations near Gouzeaucourt, the 4th Battalion
proceeded to Etricourt, where they entrained
for Laherliere. Thence they marched to Gouy-en-Artois,
and were placed in comfortable billets
in a château. On December 11 they proceeded
to Dainville, where they remained till the end
of the month training. The weather became
very cold and misty, and later there was a good
deal of snow. On the 23rd the following officers
joined the Battalion: Lieutenant F. C. Lyon,
the <abbr title="Honorable">Hon.</abbr> C. C. S. Rodney, Second Lieutenant B. R.
Osborne, Second Lieutenant R. D. Richardson,
and Second Lieutenant C. J. Dawson-Greene.</p>

<p class="p1">After the operations at Bixschoote in October,
the 1st Battalion remained in billets at Zudroue,
near Watten. During this period the following
<!--349.png--><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317"></a><span class="pageno">317</span>
officers joined the Battalion: Lieutenant I. C.
Gascoigne, Second Lieutenant D. B. Topham,
Lieutenant R. D. Lawford, Second Lieutenant
A. H. Forbes, Second Lieutenant C. Cruttenden,
and Lieutenant H. G. Wiggins. Captain H. H.
Castle, <abbr title="Royal Army Medical Corps">R.A.M.C.</abbr>, also arrived to take the place
of Captain P. H. Wells, <abbr title="Royal Army Medical Corps">R.A.M.C.</abbr> While the
Battalion was at Zudroue, the Colonel of the
Regiment, Field-Marshal H.R.H. the Duke of
Connaught, paid them a visit.</p>

<p>On November 9 the move south began, and
the 1st Battalion marched to Enquin-les-Mines,
continuing its march on the following day to
Fabain Palfart, and then on to Foolinricametz.
Second Lieutenant S. J. Hargreaves joined from
the base on the 15th. The march was continued on
the 17th through Ivergny Pommier to Achiet-le-Petit,
where the men had twenty-four hours’ rest.
The greatest secrecy was preserved, and no orders
were issued to the Company Commanders till
the last moment, though from the great concentration
of troops it seemed clear that some big
move was impending. The 1st Battalion was
brought up in buses to Beaumetz-les-Cambrai,
and from there it marched with the rest of
Seymour’s Brigade to Flesquières. Though two
Battalions of the Brigade were sent up to support
the Fortieth Division, which was taking
Bourlon Wood, the 1st Battalion did not take
part in these operations. On the night of the
27th the 1st Battalion Grenadiers and the 1st
Battalion Welsh Guards, assisted by two Companies
from the 2nd Battalion Coldstream
Guards, relieved the 2nd Guards Brigade in the
<!--350.png--><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318"></a><span class="pageno">318</span>
front line. The following officers took part in
these operations:</p>

<p>Conditions were favourable for carrying out
the relief, and the next day passed without
incident, although the enemy continued to shell
the valley south of Bourlon Wood. On the
evening of the 28th the 3rd Guards Brigade,
having been relieved by the Fifty-ninth Division,
marched to the reserve trenches south-west of
Ribecourt. Next day it proceeded to Havrincourt
Wood. A camp was pitched, and to make way
for the tents it was necessary to clear away the
undergrowth, which so delayed matters that it
was not till 10 <span class="sc small">P.M.</span> that every one had settled
down.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><abbr title="November">Nov.</abbr> 30.</p>

<p>Barely had the officers finished breakfast on
<!--351.png--><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319"></a><span class="pageno">319</span>
the morning of the 30th, when rumours reached
them that the Germans had broken through the
line. At first no one believed this possible, and,
as the camp was quite five miles from our front
line, a further report that the Germans were not
far off was received with incredulity. But soon
small parties of men were seen coming over the
hill, as well as gunners and horses without guns.
By degrees these isolated parties became a mob,
and the road was blocked by a torrent of
transport and men. A few shells pitched not
far from the camp, and confirmed the news of
the approach of the Germans. At the same
time there arrived a warning order to be ready
to move at a moment’s notice, and soon the
whole camp was filled with bustle and excitement.</p>

<p>The first warning said that Seymour’s Brigade
was to be ready to take up a defensive position
on the ridge of Havrincourt Wood. This was
cancelled later, and the Brigade was told to
concentrate at a point near Metz. As soon as
the order was confirmed, the 1st Battalion moved
off to join the rest of the Brigade on the Trescault&mdash;Metz
road. The march was trying, as the
road was blocked with traffic, all moving in the
opposite direction. At some points the Brigade
encountered as many as three limbers abreast.
Sometimes, therefore, the troops had to go in
single file through a mass of vehicles and men, and
then to double so as to keep touch with those
in front. Being on a hill, the road was clearly
visible for miles, and the Germans soon started
hammering it with high-explosive shells, which
added to the general confusion. It requires a
<!--352.png--><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320"></a><span class="pageno">320</span>
very highly disciplined force to move quickly
against such a stream as this was, but the men
never checked their pace for a moment. Spades
and shovels were drawn in Metz, and the whole
Brigade was soon ready to advance in artillery
formation. The 1st Battalion followed the Welsh
Guards across country in the direction of Gouzeaucourt
and Villers Plouich. Brigadier-General
Lord Henry Seymour rode on in front with his
Staff.</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="sc">Attack on Gonnelieu</span></p>

<p class="p1">The position taken up by the Brigade was
just under the crest of the ridge, running north
from Gouzeaucourt Wood, and the 1st Battalion
bivouacked for the night within half a mile of
the camp in Havrincourt Wood, where the stores
and transport had remained. As the night was
bitterly cold, one blanket per man and the officers’
trench kits were fetched, and eventually, when
the cookers came up, tea and porridge was given
out to the men.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><abbr title="December">Dec.</abbr> 1.</p>

<p>At 4 <span class="sc small">A.M.</span>, after the Company Commanders
had returned from reconnoitring, orders were
issued for the 1st Battalion to move by Companies
in artillery formation, and take up a line
on the railway between Gouzeaucourt on the
right and Villers Plouich on the left. By 9 <span class="sc small">A.M.</span>
the Companies were in position: <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 2, under
Captain Rhodes, on the right and in touch with
the 4th Battalion Grenadiers; <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 3, under
Captain Spence, in the centre; <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 4, under
Captain Lawford, on the left; and the King’s
Company, under Lieutenant Harvard, in reserve.</p>

<p><!--353.png--><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321"></a><span class="pageno">321</span>
Both the railway and a sunken road which
ran parallel with it were shelled incessantly by
the enemy, while machine-gun bullets also swept
down the line from the direction of Gonnelieu.
The 4th Battalion Grenadiers and the 1st Battalion
Welsh Guards were ordered to undertake
the attack, while the 1st Battalion was to be
in support, and guard the left flank as the
advance progressed. At 6.20 <span class="sc small">A.M.</span> the attack
began, and a rather feeble bombardment was
continued for ten minutes by three Brigades of
<abbr title="Royal Field Artillery">R.F.A.</abbr> Twenty-two tanks had been allotted
to the Division, eight of which were to co-operate
with Seymour’s Brigade.</p>

<p><abbr title="Lieutenant">Lieut.</abbr>-Colonel Maitland summoned the four
Company Commanders to Battalion Headquarters,
and they started off just as the
Germans were putting down a heavy barrage
on the railway. As they made their way along
the embankment, shells were pitching among
the men, and causing groups of casualties.
As soon as any reinforcements were wanted,
Captain Rhodes was to take his Company
up the sunken road from Gouzeaucourt to
Gonnelieu. <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 3 and <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 4 Companies were
to advance across the open, so as to be near at
hand when called upon. The Company Commanders
scrambled back to their Companies,
and explained the general idea to their Platoon
Commanders as far as time would permit. It
was a trying time for the men, who had to sit
still as mere targets for the German gunners,
and watch their comrades again and again
being blown to pieces. They felt that even an
<!--354.png--><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322"></a><span class="pageno">322</span>
advance under machine-gun fire would have been
preferable.</p>

<p>As soon as the attack started, the 1st Battalion
advanced under a hail of bullets, although
there was no artillery fire, and many men fell at
once. The 4th Battalion Grenadiers, which it
supported, was at first so successful that it
outstripped the troops on the left, and consequently
had that flank in the air. Lord Henry
Seymour sent orders to the 1st Battalion to
secure the high ground to the north of Gonnelieu,
hoping that by this means it would not only
secure the left flank of the 4th Battalion, but
also materially assist it to hold the village.
The 1st Battalion had therefore to advance half
left, and after going about 600 yards it was
joined by men of various regiments.</p>

<p>Complete success attended the first part of the
attack, and the three leading Companies, by a
free use of the bayonet, captured the first German
trench they reached. It was then necessary to
“mop up,” and clear all possible hiding-places
where any Germans might be lurking. Apparently
the enemy had been taken unawares,
and there were traces everywhere of surprise
and precipitate flight. One German officer was
caught while changing his clothes, and had
nothing on but a shirt. The men stood up, and
fired their rifles from the shoulder at the retreating
Germans, and the Lewis gunners did their work
well. A large number of the enemy were killed,
and 110 prisoners were taken. <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 3 Company,
under Captain Spence, was on the right, in touch
with the 4th Battalion, and <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 4, under Captain
<!--355.png--><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323"></a><span class="pageno">323</span>
Lawford, on the left, in touch with the 2nd
Battalion Scots Guards. <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 2, under Captain
Rhodes, in the centre, had the most difficult
task, as it had continually to swing round to keep
up with the Companies on either flank.</p>

<p>Having succeeded so well with the first
trench, the 1st Battalion continued its advance
until it arrived at a well-wired trench north
of Gonnelieu. The three leading Companies
managed to get through gaps in the wire, and
push on, but when they topped the ridge they
were met with a terrific machine-gun fire, which
staggered them, and caused many casualties. It
seemed madness to advance in the open against
well-posted machine-guns, and orders were
therefore given to withdraw to the trench they
had already gained. In the meantime five tanks
were seen advancing up to the ridge south of
Gonnelieu; three of them were put out of action
before they reached the village, and none were
able to enter the village itself. Captain Spence,
finding that his Company had run short of
ammunition, sent back a small party to fetch
some from Battalion Headquarters.</p>

<p>During the last advance Lieutenant Chamberlain,
who had gone on too far, had been either
cut off or killed, and half of <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 2 Company,
having gone astray, was nowhere to be seen.
The whole line in fact had been bent to a semicircle,
and needed reorganising. Lieutenant
Wiggins was sent by Captain Spence to get
touch with <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 2, which should have been on
his right, and, after hunting about for some time,
reported that he could find no trace of this half-Company.
<!--356.png--><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324"></a><span class="pageno">324</span>
At the same time Second Lieutenant
Cruttenden went off to find Lieutenant Chamberlain,
and after a fruitless search was shot through
the lungs by a sniper. By degrees every one got
into his right place, and the missing half of <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 2
Company was retrieved by Captain Rhodes.</p>

<p>As soon as it became dark, began the difficult
task of collecting the wounded and getting them
down to the dressing-station. The stretcher-bearers
worked indefatigably all night, and were
assisted by any men who could be spared.
Another search-party, under Sergeant Porter,
went out to find Lieutenant Chamberlain, but
was no more successful than the first.</p>

<p>Next day the Battalion remained in the same
position, but two platoons were sent off to reinforce
the line held by the 4th Battalion. That
night the 1st Battalion was relieved, partly by
the 2nd Battalion Scots Guards, and partly by
a battalion of the 183rd Brigade, and was sent
off to relieve the Welsh Guards. As the 2nd
Battalion Scots Guards did not arrive till dawn,
<abbr title="Numbers">Nos.</abbr> 3 and 4 Companies had to hold on all night.
There was a rumour that Seymour’s Brigade
would continue the attack on Gonnelieu the next
day, but nothing came of it. On December 3
the whole position was severely shelled, and there
were several casualties, including Lieutenant
Bevan, who was wounded.</p>

<p>In the evening the Battalion was relieved,
and retired to Gouzeaucourt, where it remained
in reserve. On the 6th it moved to Etricourt,
where Second Lieutenant F. H. Ennor and Second
Lieutenant R. C. Bruce arrived, and on the 11th
<!--357.png--><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325"></a><span class="pageno">325</span>
it retired to Arras, where it remained till the end
of the month. Second Lieutenant A. Forbes and
Second Lieutenant V. A. N. Wall rejoined from
the Reinforcement Battalion on the 16th.</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="sc">The 2nd Battalion</span></p>

<p class="p1 sidenote">2nd <abbr title="Battalion">Batt.</abbr></p>

<p class="p1">For the rest of October the 2nd Battalion
remained at Tournehem in the area between
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Omer and Calais, carrying out training of all
kinds. Lieutenant O. Martin Smith and Lieutenant
S. T. S. Clarke arrived on the 18th.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><abbr title="November">Nov.</abbr></p>

<p>On November 11 the Battalion with the
rest of De Crespigny’s Brigade started their
march south, through Herbelle, Lairs, and La
Thieulloye. A Divisional Reinforcement Battalion
was now formed. This was a new idea,
which had gradually come to be adopted, whenever
an attack was impending, and which had
been rendered necessary by the large numbers
of all ranks who were left behind whenever
offensive operations were undertaken. Companies
at that time neither attacked nor went
into the line with a greater average strength
than 32 other ranks per platoon and 3 officers
per Company, and the Reinforcement Battalion
was designed to take charge of the remainder.
Though some such scheme was doubtless necessary,
its application inevitably proved chaotic,
for a hurriedly improvised Battalion Staff administered
by the A. and Q. branches, who were
themselves always at their busiest time, when
the Reinforcement Battalion came into existence,
hardly made an ideal administrative machine.
<!--358.png--><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326"></a><span class="pageno">326</span>
From the Battalion point of view the result was
desperate. All ranks returning from leave were
usually detained at the Reinforcement Battalion,
so that it was never known from day to day
what officers, <abbr title="Non Commissioned Officer">N.C.O.</abbr>’s, and men would be available
for duty, nor was it possible to obtain
appropriate substitutes to fill deficiencies caused
by sickness.</p>

<p>On the 13th there was a Divisional Conference,
which was attended by the Brigadiers and Commanding
Officers, when Major-General Fielding
outlined the future operations. After four
days spent at La Thieulloye the Battalion
marched to Manin, and on the 18th went into
camp between Blaireville and Hendecourt. There
the Commanding Officer held a conference, at
which he explained the scope and intention of
the forthcoming operations. On the 19th the
Battalion marched by night from Blaireville,
through Hamelincourt and Ervillers, to a tented
camp at Gomiecourt. A full moon lit the road,
and the Battalion was in great spirits, all the
companies singing on the march, and all ranks
feeling the suppressed excitement which precedes
an attack. The road passed through an area
which the Battalion was to know very well four
months later, when it was called upon to stem
the German onslaught.</p>

<p>After two nights in this camp the Battalion
proceeded in buses to huts near Barastre, where it
was quartered in very comfortable billets. It was
nearly dawn by the time the troops settled down,
as the journey had been slow and laborious owing
to the congestion on the roads, which, though
<!--359.png--><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327"></a><span class="pageno">327</span>
deserted by day, were crowded with men and
vehicles from dark to dawn.</p>

<p>November 23rd was one of the most remarkable
days in the Battalion’s experience. Starting
from camp near Barastre in the dark at 5.30 <span class="sc small">A.M.</span>,
it marched through Velu to a field on the western
outskirts of Doignies, which was reached about
9.30 <span class="sc small">A.M.</span> Here the men drew bivouac-sheets,
and set to work to make provision for the night,
having been told that no move would be undertaken
that day, whilst the Commanding Officer
and most of the Company Commanders went
out to reconnoitre various routes. Early in the
afternoon an order was received that the Battalion
would be required to move at short notice,
and that it would relieve a Battalion in the line
that night. Marching orders were issued, and
bivouac-sheets returned. Shortly after 7 <span class="sc small">P.M.</span>
an order was received that the Battalion was to
march off immediately; it was not known what
Battalion was to be relieved, nor where it was,
but it was said that definite orders would be
received at the Canal du Nord. General de
Crespigny had gone off to reconnoitre the forward
area, and had not returned.</p>

<p>The whole of De Crespigny’s Brigade and
part of Seymour’s Brigade were found to be on
the same track, and as it was already congested
by the passage in both directions of ammunition
limbers, ambulances, and traffic of every description,
progress was slow and wearisome. During
the course of the march, the Lewis-gun limbers,
which had started with the Battalion, but had
become slightly separated in the press of the
<!--360.png--><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328"></a><span class="pageno">328</span>
traffic, were diverted by a Staff Officer. The
Battalion Headquarters were not informed of
this, and consequently it was not until some
time after their departure that the absence of
the guns became known. On reaching the Canal
crossing at Lock 7 the Battalion halted, and
the men fell out on the side of the road to snatch
a few minutes’ sleep, while Captain A. Penn,
the Adjutant, rode forward to meet Lieutenant-Colonel
Follett, who was commanding the Brigade
in the temporary absence of General de Crespigny.
From Colonel Follett it was learnt that the
Brigade to be relieved was in the neighbourhood
of Cantaing. <abbr title="Lieutenant">Lieut.</abbr>-Colonel Rasch thereupon
rode forward to find the outgoing Battalion, to
arrange for guides, and to borrow Lewis guns,
while the Battalion wearily followed the road
through Graincourt. The men who were not
required to take part in the operations were
diverted from the main body, and sent off under
Lieutenant Drummond and Lieutenant Layland-Barratt,
to find their way to Ribecourt. The
march was undisturbed, and the night quiet, save
on the hill crowned by Bourlon Wood, which
all night was intermittently shelled.</p>

<p>Near Brigade Headquarters at La Justice
Farm, north of Orival Wood, the Battalion
met guides from the 9th Battalion Royal Scots
(152nd Brigade), which was holding the first line
on the eastern outskirts of Cantaing. Thanks
to the admirable arrangements made by this
Battalion, which had been heavily engaged for
some days past, the remainder of the relief passed
off without difficulty. Just before daylight the
<!--361.png--><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329"></a><span class="pageno">329</span>
Battalion completed a relief, which the Royal
Scots at any rate believed to be impossible of
achievement, in view of the demands it made
on the endurance of the men, who had been
on the move almost unceasingly for twenty-four
hours.</p>

<p>When once the relief was complete, the tour
passed without incident, except that Lieutenant
Alexander was wounded in the hand, whilst throwing
from the slit he was occupying an enemy
grenade, which had fallen unexploded among his
men.</p>

<p><abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 2 Company was on the right, stretching
towards Bois Neuf, and in touch with the 8th Battalion
Bedfordshire Regiment; <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 4 on the left
held a line of posts just east of the Cantaing&mdash;Fontaine
road, facing La Folie Wood, and in
touch with the 1st Battalion Irish Guards, which
stretched towards Bourlon Wood; <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 1 was in
support, and <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 3 in reserve. Everywhere there
were signs of the rapidity with which the British
attack had swept the enemy from his trenches,
and derelict and charred tanks, scattered in all
directions, bore evidence of the stubborn resistance
with which our advance had been met.
The country was open and undulating, and the
spires of Cambrai were distinctly visible in the
clear wintry light. On the 26th the Battalion was
relieved, and marched back in a blinding snowstorm
to Ribecourt, passing the Battalions of
the 2nd Guards Brigade, on their way to carry out
the attack on Fontaine-Notre-Dame. The night
spent at Ribecourt was one of the most miserable
passed by the Battalion. Soaked by the snowstorm,
<!--362.png--><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330"></a><span class="pageno">330</span>
through which they had marched from
Cantaing, and sodden with mud from the line,
the men, whose blankets and greatcoats had been
stored when the advance began, found no accommodation
but a few leaky shelters in the Hindenburg
Line. All the dug-outs with any possibilities
of comfort had already been occupied by the
swarm of troops following the advance. In the
afternoon of the 28th, orders were received to
march to billets in Metz, and thither the Battalion
went in the evening, finding on its arrival
rather cramped but quite comfortable quarters.</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="sc">The Capture of Gouzeaucourt</span></p>

<p class="p1">At daybreak on 30th November the sound
of a heavy bombardment on a wide front made it
clear that the enemy was undertaking a counter-attack.
At the same time a long-range gun
began to drop shells into Metz, where the Battalion
was resting, causing casualties to the troops
billeted there. The village street was quickly
choked with a miscellaneous rabble of soldiers
of every kind, all streaming back in hopeless confusion,
and spreading rumours of a break-through
by the enemy. Soon after 9 <span class="sc small">A.M.</span> a message
was received from General de Crespigny that
the Third Corps was being heavily attacked at
Gonnelieu, about four miles away, and ordering
the Battalion to move at short notice. At 10.30
<abbr title="Lieutenant">Lieut.</abbr>-Colonel Rasch was told to march the Battalion
towards Gouzeaucourt, and to clear Metz
by 12.25 <span class="sc small">P.M.</span> He handed over the command of
the Battalion to Captain Harcourt-Vernon, and
<!--363.png--><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331"></a><span class="pageno">331</span>
rode off to the Brigade Headquarters to get as
much information as possible.</p>

<p>Half a mile from Metz, <abbr title="Lieutenant">Lieut.</abbr>-Colonel Rasch
and the Company Commanders, who had preceded
the Battalion, rejoined, with the news that De
Crespigny’s Brigade was to advance immediately
towards Gouzeaucourt, which was reported to
be in the hands of the Germans: the 1st Battalion
Irish Guards on the north of the Gouzeaucourt&mdash;Metz
road, the 3rd Battalion Coldstream
in the centre, and the 2nd Battalion Coldstream
on the right; the 2nd Battalion Grenadiers in
Brigade support.</p>

<p>The whole countryside was by this time
dotted with men retiring, and the A.P.M. at the
Metz cross-roads was busily engaged in dealing
with stragglers; throughout the advance of the
<!--364.png--><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332"></a><span class="pageno">332</span>
Brigade no trace was seen of any defending
infantry. On clearing the village, the Battalion
assumed artillery formation, and advanced to
Gouzeaucourt Wood, a low scrubby plantation
crowning the ridge which bisects the ground
lying between Metz and Gouzeaucourt. Here
the Battalion waited full of anxious curiosity.
Shelling caused a few casualties, but the protection
of the rising ground sheltered it from
the rifle and machine-gun fire, directed at the
leading battalions, which were now advancing
towards Gouzeaucourt village. The capture of
Gouzeaucourt was a fine achievement carried
out with wonderful precision. So successful was
it that the Battalion was never required: by
nightfall the village had been completely cleared
of the enemy, and all British stores had been
recovered. When it was known that the Battalion
was not likely to be called upon until the
next day, cookers were brought up, and provision
for the cold night was made as far as possible.</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="sc">Capture of Gauche Wood</span></p>

<p class="p1 sidenote"><abbr title="December">Dec.</abbr> 1.</p>

<p class="p1">At 2.30 <span class="sc small">A.M.</span> General de Crespigny received
orders to attack and capture Gauche Wood, in
co-operation with Seymour’s Brigade on the left,
and the cavalry on the right. The objective of
the Battalion was the eastern edge of Gauche
Wood, and the 3rd Battalion Coldstream was to
be on the left. This wood was oblong in shape,
and measured approximately 700 by 300 yards;
its nearest corner was about 1200 yards from
the line which the Brigade had taken up the
<!--367.png--><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333"></a><span class="pageno">333</span>
night before. Orders were written and explained
to the Company Commanders. The Battalion
was to form up behind a sunken road on the
eastern outskirts of Gouzeaucourt village, which
then constituted the front line. Twenty tanks
were allotted to the Brigade, but as there seemed
grave doubt as to whether they would be able to
reach their rendezvous at so short notice, companies
were ordered not to wait for them.</p>

   December 1st 1917</p>
</div>

<!--366.png--><!--Blank Page-->
<p>In the 2nd Battalion the attack was undertaken
by <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 1 Company under Lieutenant Cornforth
on the right, and <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 3 under Lieutenant
Acland on the left, each in two lines of two
platoons, followed at a distance of 250 yards
by <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 4 under Lieutenant Westmacott, and
<abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 2 under Lieutenant Browning, in similar
formation. <abbr title="Lieutenant">Lieut.</abbr>-Colonel Rasch went on ahead
with the Company Commanders to reconnoitre
the forming-up ground, whilst the Battalion
followed after breakfast, and picked up tools on
the way. At 6.30 the artillery support, which
was most attenuated, opened and searched the
wood and the ravine behind it. No tanks had yet
put in an appearance, and, after giving them ten
minutes’ grace, the attack was launched without
them.</p>

<p>The enemy retaliated with a heavy barrage,
most of which fortunately fell behind the advancing
troops, but the machine-gun fire made it
doubtful whether any one would ever reach the
wood. When the attack opened, all four companies
advanced at a great pace over the intervening
grass land, which rose in a gentle slope
up to the wood. It is difficult to understand why,
<!--368.png--><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334"></a><span class="pageno">334</span>
with the machine-guns posted at the edge of the
wood, the enemy did not wipe out the whole
Battalion. Ignoring all regulations about short
rushes, both officers and men went straight for
the wood as fast as they could. They instinctively
felt that the only chance was to cover the
mile of naked slope in the shortest possible time.
In all probability the German machine-gunners
in the half-light of the morning became flurried,
at seeing this formidable attack sweeping over the
ground, for, although the fire was very hot, the
bullets passed over the men’s heads, and it was
not until they had nearly reached the wood that
casualties occurred. Here the fringe of German
machine-guns, established at the edge of the
wood, began to take heavy toll, and then began
perhaps the fiercest fighting of all. When the
leading companies reached the wood, it became a
struggle of man to man. But the Germans soon
found that with the bayonet they were no match
for the Grenadiers. Back into the wood they
were forced, and then-down into a hollow in the
centre of it. Their machine-guns were all captured,
and, although some fought stubbornly,
most of them were driven slowly up the incline
on the far side into the corner of the wood.
Second Lieutenant Pearson was killed as he went
through the wood, and Second Lieutenant Harbord,
whilst most gallantly rushing a machine-gun,
received wounds from which he died later
in the day. Lieutenants Cornforth, Drummond,
Dent, Kendal, Acland, and Magnay were all
wounded, and the Battalion lost many valuable
<abbr title="Non Commissioned Officer">N.C.O.</abbr>’s.</p>

<p><!--369.png--><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335"></a><span class="pageno">335</span>
This left Lieutenant Browning and Lieutenant
Westmacott responsible for the whole Battalion
front, and to them the success of the attack was
largely due. Between them they reorganised
and controlled the whole line, making their dispositions
with great skill. On reaching the wood,
Lieutenant Westmacott faced part of his company
to the right flank, to guard against a counter-attack
from the south. Hardly had he done so when
about seventy Germans appeared; they were met
with steady rifle-fire from the wood, and wavered
for a moment, uncertain as to what they should
do, but they finally made for the wood. Our fire,
however, was too steady for them, and accounted
for all but a handful of men, who were taken
prisoners. Soon afterwards another party of sixty
appeared from the same direction, but they also
were met with so well-directed a fire that they
were staggered, whereupon the men of <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 4
Company charged them with the bayonet.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Westmacott now decided that he
must push his men farther forward on the right
flank of the wood, so as to command the valley,
which lay between the wood and the village of
Villers Guislain. He had just moved forward
his company, and prolonged the right with two
platoons of <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 2 Company, when some dismounted
cavalry, consisting of the 18th Bengal Lancers
and a detachment of the 7th Dragoon Guards,
appeared from the same direction as the enemy
attacks. Their orders had not enabled them to
attack simultaneously with the 2nd Battalion,
and it was in all probability this delayed advance
that precipitated the two unfruitful attempts of
<!--370.png--><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336"></a><span class="pageno">336</span>
the enemy to gain the wood. Their arrival was
of the greatest value, and at Lieutenant Westmacott’s
suggestion they proceeded to reinforce
the other companies, which were meanwhile fighting
their way through the wood. Several tanks
had by now put in an appearance, although the
majority had been knocked out before they
reached the wood, by a most accurate shell-fire
directed by a low-flying aeroplane. The lack of
any particular trench for the surviving tanks
to attack made their fire ineffectual, and their
presence seemed to attract the shells of all the
German batteries in the neighbourhood, causing
many casualties in the Battalion.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Layland-Barratt, who had been
assisting Lieutenant Browning to reorganise the
companies in the wood, was wounded by a splinter
of a shell, and had to retire to a dressing-station.
This left only Lieutenant Browning in the wood,
and Lieutenant Westmacott and Lieutenant
Loftus outside.</p>

<p><abbr title="Lieutenant">Lieut.</abbr>-Colonel Rasch went up to the line,
and organised a readjustment of the companies.
<abbr title="Lieutenant">Lieut.</abbr>-Colonel E. C. Corbyn, commanding the
18th Bengal Lancers, was asked to withdraw his
men to the centre of the wood so as to form a
reserve, and dig a support line on some commanding
ground in the wood. The dash and fighting
spirit of all ranks of this regiment, and the help
and experience which Colonel Corbyn gave at that
critical moment, made the greatest impression
on the Battalion, and enabled the Grenadiers to
realise how great a loss his regiment suffered, when
he was killed by a shell later in the afternoon.</p>

<p><!--371.png--><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337"></a><span class="pageno">337</span>
In a letter describing this attack an officer of
the 18th Bengal Lancers wrote:</p>

<p class="blockquote">We then occupied the captured trench sandwiched
in between the Grenadiers and Coldstream.… I have
now seen His Majesty’s Guards in action and fought
alongside of them, and I take off my hat to them. They
can die like gentlemen, without a groan. Four of our
men were carrying a Guardsman who appeared to be
suffering considerably. I asked him who he was, and
he instinctively straightened himself as best he could
and said, “A Grenadier,” his tone implying how proud
he was to be one, and, what I also thought, “how
magnificent they were.”</p>

<p>The comradeship between the two regiments
was later marked by the presentation of a
Grenadier Bugle, with an inscription, which the
Battalion gave to the 18th Bengal Lancers. Subsequently
the Lancers presented the 2nd Battalion
with a silver statuette of a mounted Bengal
Lancer, on the plinth of which was the following
inscription: “To <abbr title="Lieutenant">Lieut.</abbr>-Colonel G. E. C. Rasch,
<abbr title="Distinguished Service Order">D.S.O.</abbr>, and Officers of the 2nd Battalion Grenadier
Guards, as a memento of Gauche Wood.”</p>

<p>On the return of <abbr title="Lieutenant">Lieut.</abbr>-Colonel Rasch, Captain
Harcourt-Vernon went up to the line, taking with
him some ammunition and also a company of
the 2nd Battalion Coldstream, under Captain H.
Brierley, <abbr title="Military Cross">M.C.</abbr>, which had been sent to prolong the
right flank, still dangerously in the air. In the
afternoon a party of Strathcona’s Horse began
an attack, and made very little headway. Half
a squadron came into the wood, but was withdrawn
later to link up the right of the Brigade
line with the remainder of Strathcona’s Horse.</p>

<p><!--372.png--><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338"></a><span class="pageno">338</span>
Shelling continued almost without cessation
during the rest of the day, but no further enemy
action developed, and about 10 <span class="sc small">P.M.</span>, in heavy
rain, the Battalion began to be relieved by the
Deccan and Poona Horse and one company of
the 3rd Battalion Grenadiers, under Captain
Ridley, and marched back to bivouacs in
Gouzeaucourt Wood. There it remained until
December 5, when the Guards Division was
relieved, and retired out of the area of operations.
The casualties in the Battalion were 153 killed,
wounded, and missing; among the twelve Company
Officers who went into action, one was killed,
one died of wounds, and seven were wounded.
The percentage of <abbr title="Non Commissioned Officer">N.C.O.</abbr>’s killed was also very
high, including many first-rate sergeants. Three
field-guns and twelve machine-guns, in addition
to many prisoners, were captured in this attack.
The Battalion proceeded by train to Beaumetz,
and went into billets at Berneville, where it
remained until, the end of the month.</p>

<p>The following officers joined during December:
Second Lieutenant F. J. Langley, Lieutenant
G. B. Wilson, Second Lieutenant R. T. Sharpe,
Second Lieutenant C. C. T. Giles, and Second
Lieutenant S. C. K. George.</p>

<p class="p1">During the last ten days of October and the
first week of November, the 3rd Battalion was
in good billets at Moule. During that time,
Lieutenant G. W. Godman, Second Lieutenant
G. H. R. Hoare, and Second Lieutenant E. C. Long
<!--373.png--><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339"></a><span class="pageno">339</span>
arrived. On the 21st the Battalion was inspected
by the Duke of Connaught, and lined both sides
of the Calais&mdash;<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Omer road. On the 25th the
whole Guards Division was inspected by the
Commander-in-Chief, Field-Marshal Sir Douglas
Haig.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><abbr title="November">Nov.</abbr> 10.</p>

<p class="p1">On November 10 the march south began, and
the 3rd Battalion proceeded to Enquingatte.
On the following days it marched through
Heuchin, Hernicourt, Houvin, Bailleulval, Courcelles-le-Comte,
Beulencourt, and Le Bacquiere to
Ribecourt, which it reached after a fortnight’s
hard marching. There the men had twenty-four
hours’ rest, during which they managed to
collect a considerable amount of salvage, and on
<span class="sidenote"><abbr title="November">Nov.</abbr> 26.</span>
the 26th they quietly took over the line, round the
south-east edge of Bourlon Wood, opposite the
village of Fontaine-Notre-Dame, from the 3rd
Battalion Coldstream. That evening Sergison-Brooke’s
Brigade received orders to attack a
front, extending from the village of Fontaine-Notre-Dame
to a point about 1000 yards east
of the centre of Bourlon village&mdash;that is to say,
a front of about 3500 yards. The intention to
attack Fontaine was only decided upon at the
last moment after much discussion, and even
General Sergison-Brooke himself knew nothing
of it till the afternoon of the 26th. The orders
reached the 3rd Battalion only as it was on its
way up to relieve the 3rd Battalion Coldstream.</p>

of Bourlon Wood. The second objective was the
station and the eastern outskirts of Fontaine,
which was to become the outpost line. The
3rd Battalion Grenadiers was to be on the right,
the 1st Battalion Coldstream in the centre, and
the 2nd Battalion Irish Guards on the left. The
first objective of the 3rd Battalion was half-way
through the village, including the church on the
right, after which it was to push its outposts on
to the road leading from Fontaine to La Folie
Wood.</p>

<p>As soon as Colonel Thorne received his orders,
he rode off, and collected the Company Commanders,
as the Battalion was moving through
Flesquières. Detailed orders were dictated, and
the maps were carefully marked. Two hours
later the Company Commanders overtook their
companies, and the relief began. <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 1 and
<abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 3 Companies, under Lieutenant Bowes-Lyon
and Second Lieutenant G. Hoare, were to form
the first line, with <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 2 and <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 4, under Captain
Beaumont-Nesbitt and Captain Hughes, in
support.</p>

<p>The following officers took part in the attack:</p>

<p>The night was bitterly cold, with snow and sleet
soon after midnight. At 5.30 <span class="sc small">A.M.</span> Colonel Thorne,
accompanied by the Intelligence Officer, Lieutenant
Carstairs, went round the line and found
all the companies ready for the attack, which
started at 6.20, after a very short and light artillery
preparation. It was practically dark, and as
the sleet had turned to a steady drizzle of rain it
was difficult to see more than a few yards ahead.
The tanks were late, but it was decided not to
wait for them, and the signal to advance was
given. Directly the 3rd Battalion left its trenches,
it was met by a heavy machine-gun fire from
a small house 200 yards to its right front, as
well as from the line of trenches, just east and
south of Fontaine, and began to suffer casualties.
On reaching the German line, the wire was found
to be uncut, and this, combined with the absence
of the tanks, nearly ruined the success of the
whole movement.</p>

<p>In spite of these difficulties, however, <abbr title="Numbers">Nos.</abbr> 1
and 3 Companies got through the wire, and
captured the trench, but their losses were very
heavy. It was asking a good deal of a battalion
to advance against a number of machine-guns,
with strands of uncut wire intervening, and it
was truly a marvellous performance to take the
<!--376.png--><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342"></a><span class="pageno">342</span>
enemy’s trench under such conditions. Actually
Lieutenant Bowes-Lyon with <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 1 Company
managed not only to penetrate the wire, but to
seize the machine-guns in the small house.</p>

<p>Second Lieutenant G. Hoare, who was on
the left with <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 3 Company, was wounded in
the face by a bullet, as he arrived at the
enemy’s wire, and Second Lieutenant A. C.
Knollys took over command. This company
was more fortunate than the others, for after it
had penetrated the enemy’s wire and was entering
Fontaine, the tanks came up, and enabled
it to secure the first objective without much
trouble or many casualties. The difficulty was
the mass of isolated houses, which were admirably
suited for defence, and which provided good
cover for the enemy’s machine-guns. The first
house on the north side of the road held up the
advance, until Second Lieutenant Carrington with
some of <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 4 Company came up in support of
<abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 3, and seized the house, together with all
its occupants. On the south side of the road
the enfilade machine-gun fire was terrific, and
before the men could reach the shelter of any
house, Captain Beaumont-Nesbitt was killed. The
two companies in support now came up, and the
Battalion continued from this moment to fight
practically as two half-battalions. <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 1 and
<abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 2 Companies suffered most, and all the officers
and most of the <abbr title="Non Commissioned Officer">N.C.O.</abbr>’s were killed or wounded.
In the village it became a difficult matter to
distinguish between the houses held by the
enemy and those occupied by our men, and thus
several parties were cut off.</p>

<p><!--377.png--><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343"></a><span class="pageno">343</span>
After some very fierce fighting the Germans
were slowly driven back all along the line.
Lieutenant Bowes-Lyon, who had gallantly
rushed on, was killed, and Lieutenant Worsley
shared the same fate. The remaining officers of
these two companies were all wounded: Second
Lieutenant Hollins through the foot, Second
Lieutenant Cooper through the arm, and Second
Lieutenant Long in the face and arm. A dozen
men of one party, without an officer, fought
their way through to the church, where they
joined up with some men of <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 3 Company.</p>

<p>The first objective was now secured, although
the price paid had been heavy, and the village
had to be mopped up. Here was another difficulty:
the companies were so weak that they
could not even find enough men to escort the
prisoners they had taken. Then the ammunition
began to run short, and the supply of bombs
became alarmingly low. The enemy remained
in possession of two derelict tanks, captured in
an earlier attack, and from the trenches just
south of the village were able to keep up a harassing
fire. Captain Hughes, when he came up with
<abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 4 Company, determined to push on, but
could find no signs of <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 2 Company in the
labyrinth of houses. He divided his company
into two parties, one of which he himself led to
attack the trench on the Cambrai road, while
the other, under Second Lieutenant Carrington,
was ordered to secure the Station road as far as
the Crucifix. Both parties secured their objectives,
and began to consolidate their position.</p>

<p>It was shortly afterwards discovered that the
<!--378.png--><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344"></a><span class="pageno">344</span>
right flank of <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 3 Company was in the air.
At the time nothing was known of the failure
of <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 1 and <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 2 Companies to carry their
objective, and in anticipation of their arrival a
defensive flank of a sergeant and twelve men with
a Lewis gun was formed. The valley to the south
of the village was filled with the enemy, and under
the wall of the churchyard there was a deep dug-out
full of Germans, one of whom was so placed
at the entrance that he could not be seen. Every
time a bomb was thrown from round the corner
he fired at the thrower’s hand, and managed to
kill one man and wound another. As no phosphorous
bombs were available, a guard was placed
over the entrance, and the dug-out was left for
future treatment.</p>

<p>But it was beginning to dawn on the remaining
officers of the 3rd Battalion that all was not well,
since not only did no reinforcements arrive, but
the troops on the left seemed to be in great difficulties.
Colonel Thorne went round, and told
all the parties he saw to hold on where they were,
until reinforcements came up, but the men were
being shot at from houses in all directions. A
determined counter-attack by the Germans, who
seemed to be in some force, drove back Captain
Hughes’s platoons, and Second Lieutenant Sir J.
Hanham was wounded, but the tables were soon
turned when the tanks came up, and poured a
terrific fire into the retreating enemy. Captain
Hughes, who had dealt successfully with a very
complicated operation, was now wounded, and
Second Lieutenant Carrington took command of
<abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 4 Company.</p>

<p><!--379.png--><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345"></a><span class="pageno">345</span>
The situation had begun to look very precarious.
The houses in the village, most of
which were undamaged, might easily mask the
advance of considerable numbers of the enemy,
and the men did not know how long they could
hold on to their position, without being cut off.
Although the tanks had done wonders in clearing
the streets, as well as the trenches along the
embankment, they were of very little assistance
in the village itself, where so many houses were
still untouched by artillery fire. The enemy’s
shells, which never ceased to fall, combined with
the snipers’ bullets, made the position anything
but pleasant.</p>

<p>Two companies from the 4th Battalion were
ordered up, but the situation demanded more
drastic measures, and before these small reinforcements
even started, the enemy made very heavy
counter-attacks, first from the railway-cutting
north-east of Bourlon Wood, on the left flank
of the 1st Battalion Coldstream, then against
the junction of the 1st Battalion Coldstream and
3rd Battalion Grenadiers, while a third took
place round the southern edge of the village.
Colonel Thorne decided to hold the village with
three centres of resistance, one from the cross-roads
in the centre of the village to the south
corner of the village beyond the church, under
Second Lieutenant Knollys, the second at the
cross-roads in the centre of the village, under
Lieutenant Mackay of the Machine-Gun Guards,
with two machine-guns, and the third on the left
from the cross-roads to the right flank of the
1st Battalion Coldstream, under Second Lieutenant
<!--380.png--><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346"></a><span class="pageno">346</span>
Ball. At the same time Lieutenant Carstairs
was sent up with six men, to get touch
with Lieutenant Carrington, who with thirty
men was stubbornly holding on to the position
he had gained.</p>

<p>These measures would have been very effective
if it had been merely a matter of clinging on till
reinforcements arrived, but as these depleted
companies could not expect to hold their own
for long unsupported, Colonel Thorne determined
to go back himself, and press for more troops
to be sent up. It now appeared that there was
a gap of nearly 500 yards between the 3rd
Battalion Grenadiers and 1st Battalion Coldstream,
and that the enemy were creeping
through. But so intent were they on cutting
off the Coldstream that they did not appear to
notice the Grenadiers, with the result that they
were heavily enfiladed. They retired precipitately,
but their retirement was only momentary,
for in a short time they returned with two
machine-guns. At the same time Germans were
reported to be advancing from the north in large
numbers, while the counter-attack against the
Irish Guards was developing with renewed vigour.</p>

<p>The position of the 3rd Battalion was now
perilous in the extreme. They were outflanked,
and the enemy in front was visibly increasing
in numbers. Lieutenant Mackay with the centre
party was forced to retire before a large number
of the enemy, and his withdrawal rendered the
position of both Second Lieutenant Knollys and
Second Lieutenant Ball untenable. Quite apart
from the danger of being cut off, these platoons
<!--381.png--><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347"></a><span class="pageno">347</span>
were not nearly strong enough to resist any
attack in large numbers.</p>

<p>Thus <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 4 Company, under Second Lieutenant
Carrington, was practically cut off, with the
enemy already behind it. It had held on under
the impression that another brigade would come
to its support, but found itself in danger of
being surrounded. So the men faced about and
fought their way back to the original line. No
attempt was made to hold the old German front
trench, for it was without a field of fire on the
east, and the wire was all on the wrong side,
while it could be raked by fire from the buildings
on the western end of the village at a range of
about fifty yards.</p>

<p>This, as already remarked, was one of the
only failures in which the Guards Division took
part. This splendid Brigade had been practically
decimated, and no advance had been made. The
first objective had been taken, and in some places
even the second objective was reached, but all
the work was wasted, owing to the failure of the
higher command to bring up any reinforcements.</p>

<p>The casualties were: Three officers killed and
six wounded; while among other ranks the total
casualties were 270.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><abbr title="November">Nov.</abbr> 28.</p>

<p>On the 28th the 3rd Battalion Grenadiers,
1st Battalion Coldstream, and 2nd Battalion
Irish Guards were relieved by three battalions of
Seymour’s Brigade, and remained in support in
La Justice area. That night the Guards Division
was relieved by the Fifty-ninth Division,
and withdrew to Trescault, Metz-en-Couture, and
Bertincourt.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><!--382.png--><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348"></a><span class="pageno">348</span>
<abbr title="November">Nov.</abbr> 29.</p>

<p>On the 29th Sergison-Brooke’s Brigade moved
from Trescault to Bertincourt. There they remained
until the dramatic news arrived that
the Germans had broken through our line, when
it moved to Gouzeaucourt Wood, where it
bivouacked in the open, but its services were
not required. <span class="sidenote"><abbr title="December">Dec.</abbr></span> On December 1, when De Crespigny’s
and Seymour’s Brigades attacked Gauche
Wood and Gonnelieu, it was in reserve, and that
evening it relieved De Crespigny’s Brigade in the
front line and occupied chalk trenches, in part
of Gauche Wood, and in bitterly cold weather,
with no coats or blankets, until December 4.
During those four days there was the usual
amount of shelling, but no attack was made by
either side. On the night of December 1 the
Germans brought up teams of horses to remove
two field-guns, which had been abandoned within
twenty yards of the trenches by Villers Guislain,
occupied by <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 3 Company, but were driven
off by rifle and revolver fire. On December 4
the 2nd Brigade was relieved by the 1st and
2nd South African Regiments, and retired from
the area of operations with the rest of the Guards
Division. On the 7th the Battalion moved to
Simencourt, where it remained till the end of
December. The following officers joined during
December: Second Lieutenant W. A. Pembroke,
Captain N. C. Tufnell, Lieutenant C. H. Bedford,
Lieutenant W. Champneys, Second Lieutenant
E. J. Bunbury.</p>

<p>The 1st Battalion left its billets north of the
Scarpe, and went by train to Fampoux, where it
relieved the 12th Battalion Highland Light Infantry
in the line, with three companies in the
front trench and one in reserve. On the 5th it
was relieved by the 4th Battalion Grenadiers,
and retired into Brigade Reserve for four days.
On returning to the front trenches on the 9th, a
hostile patrol was observed approaching our lines,
<!--385.png--><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351"></a><span class="pageno">351</span>
and was easily dispersed. One German appeared
without any arms or equipment, and on being
challenged gave himself up: he turned out to
be a miserable specimen belonging to the 236th
Prussian Infantry Regiment. On the 13th the
1st Battalion again went into reserve, and on the
16th retired to Arras. During the days spent in
the trenches, one man had been killed and several
wounded. Lieutenant H. B. Vernon, Second
Lieutenant J. H. Frere, Lieutenant R. Echlin,
and Second Lieutenant J. R. Nicholson joined
the Battalion, and Major Lord Lascelles left to
go through a Commanding Officers’ course at
Aldershot. On the 25th the 1st Battalion again
went into the line, relieving the 1st Battalion
Irish Guards just south of the River Scarpe.
On the 29th the enemy put down a considerable
barrage, lasting half an hour, of all calibres,
including trench mortars, on the front line
where <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 2 Company under Captain Rhodes was
posted, and made an attempt to raid the posts
in two places under cover of the barrage. They
were, however, repulsed, and never succeeded in
entering our trenches. A patrol, that subsequently
went out, found two dead and two wounded
Germans belonging to the Twenty-fourth Divisional
Sturm-Truppen, and ascertained from
one of the wounded men that the raiders had
numbered fifty, but had been prevented from
advancing any farther on account of their
barrage shooting short. The casualties in <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 2
Company were two killed and nine wounded,
mostly by shell-fire.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><abbr title="February">Feb.</abbr></p>

<p>The 1st Battalion remained in the line until
<!--386.png--><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352"></a><span class="pageno">352</span>
February 3, when it was relieved by the 1st
Battalion Welsh Guards, and retired into billets
at Arras. After four days’ rest, it returned to
the line for three days, and then proceeded to
Gordon Camp, where it remained until the
14th. It spent three more days in the trenches,
and on the 18th made a move to Baudimont
Barracks. Captain Pearson-Gregory left, to join
the Headquarters of the 3rd Guards Brigade,
and in his absence Lieutenant Lovell was appointed
acting Adjutant. Lieutenant Gascoigne
and Second Lieutenant Ames rejoined the Battalion,
and Lieutenant Ennor and Lieutenant
Moller left to take up Staff appointments. After
four days in the support trenches, the Battalion
went up into the line on the 27th. During the
various periods spent in the front trenches, there
had been a few casualties, but on the whole the
Battalion suffered very little loss during the
month.</p>

<p class="sidenote">March.</p>

<p>On March 8 Viscount Gort took over command
of the Battalion from <abbr title="Lieutenant">Lieut.</abbr>-Colonel Maitland.
A strong German Offensive was now daily expected,
and the Battalion was consequently
reduced to fighting strength, the surplus men
being sent to the Guards Divisional Reinforcement
Battalion. But although the enemy’s
working-parties could be distinctly heard, nothing
in the nature of an attack from the enemy took
place during the first fortnight in March. The
artillery on both sides was very active, and
never ceased sending over shells. On March 15
the 1st Battalion retired to Gordon Camp, and
remained always on the alert, so that it could be
<!--387.png--><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353"></a><span class="pageno">353</span>
available at three-quarters of an hour’s notice.
Advantage was taken of a week’s rest to have
football matches, boxing contests, and musical
entertainments in the evening, after the day’s
training had been done. This undoubtedly
freshened up the men, and helped them to forget
the monotony of trench life. On the 20th
Captain Greville came from the 4th Battalion to
take up the duties of second in command. On
the 21st Major-General Feilding sent for the
Battalion Commanders, and expounded his views
on the various rôles in a counter-attack, which
the Division might be called upon to play. It
was of course impossible to issue any definite
orders, since everything depended on where and
in what strength the Germans contemplated
making their attack.</p>

<p>On the 22nd Brigadier-General Lord Henry
Seymour took with him in buses the Commanding
Officers of Battalions as well as the Company
Commanders, to reconnoitre the ground round
Henin. As soon as Lord Gort returned, the
Battalion was ordered to move at half an hour’s
notice in buses to the Mercatel area. At 6 <span class="sc small">P.M.</span>
it reached its destination, and went into billets
in some Nissen huts in the neighbourhood of
that village. Immediately on arrival Lord Gort
took the Company Commanders with him, to
reconnoitre the 3rd system to the north-east of
Boiry Becquerelle, and on the 23rd the Battalion
went up into the front line with the King’s
Company under Lieutenant Lloyd on the right,
<abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 2 under Lieutenant Harvard in the centre,
and <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 3 under Captain Stein on the left, while
<abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 4 under Lieutenant Mays remained in reserve.
Patrols were at once sent out along the whole
front, but discovered nothing, although a number
of the enemy had been seen assembling in the
sunken roads leading to Henin.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><abbr title="March">Mar.</abbr> 24.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 24th the Germans
commenced an attack across the front of the
Battalion, and were caught by enfilade fire from
Captain Stein’s Company, which inflicted heavy
losses on them as they advanced. The troops
employed by the enemy seemed to have been
<!--389.png--><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355"></a><span class="pageno">355</span>
well trained in the new method of attack, and
men were dribbled forward to their assembly
positions, where they deployed into waves for the
attack, but when they came under our machine-gun,
Lewis-gun, and rifle fire, they soon began
to bunch in groups. It seemed as if the enemy’s
troops had started with the intention of carrying
out the operation at the double for the whole
3000 yards. In order even to attempt this, they
must have undergone a considerable training to
reach the standard of physical fitness necessary
for such an attack. Round discs were used to
maintain the correct direction, and the flanks of
the attack were marked by flags. In other
respects they appeared to have evolved no new
ideas in minor tactics, and the absence of any
covering fire during the advance was most
noticeable. Light machine-guns followed up in
rear of the assault, and only came into action to
cover the retirement of the defeated “Sturm-Truppen.”</p>

<p class="sidenote"><abbr title="March">Mar.</abbr> 25.</p>

<p>On the 25th patrols were again pushed out,
and, although the enemy could be seen moving
about on the Croiselles&mdash;Henin road, the day
passed quietly. That night, in accordance with
verbal instructions received over the telephone,
the 1st Battalion withdrew to the Army line,
commencing the evacuation of the front trenches
at 11.30 <span class="sc small">P.M.</span> Although the orders for this
retirement were originally received at 2.20 <span class="sc small">P.M.</span>,
they were subsequently cancelled, and it was
not until 1.30 <span class="sc small">A.M.</span> that the retirement was
carried out after verbal orders over the telephone
had been received. The only incident that
<!--390.png--><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356"></a><span class="pageno">356</span>
occurred during this withdrawal was the approach
of an enemy patrol towards the rearguard
platoon of the King’s company, which at once
opened fire on them. The hostile patrol scattered,
and the retirement was carried out without
further molestation. Lord Gort kept two
platoons from <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 4 Company in their position,
to ensure that no troops of the Guards Division
had been left east of the Arras&mdash;Bapaume road.
He also telephoned to the officer commanding
the Royal Scots Fusiliers, and satisfied himself
that this regiment was conforming with his
movements before he withdrew the rearguard.</p>

<p>The new sector occupied by the 1st Battalion
was to the north-east of Boisieux-<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>-Marc, and
was held by Lieutenant Lloyd’s, Lieutenant
Harvard’s, and Captain Stein’s Companies, each
having two platoons in close support in shell
slits. The 2nd Battalion Scots Guards was on the
right, and the Royal Scots Fusiliers on the left.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><abbr title="March">Mar.</abbr> 26.</p>

<p>One and a half hours before dawn the next
day outpost patrols, consisting of picked shots,
were pushed forward by each Company in the
line, so that any attempt on the part of the
enemy to occupy Boiry Becquerelle might be
instantly reported. At 7.30 one patrol sent back
the information that the Germans could be seen,
advancing in large numbers in artillery formation,
and covered by a screen of scouts. The enemy’s
aircraft had been busy since the preceding day,
in flying over this area, while the German artillery
continued to shell the western end of Boiry
Becquerelles and the Arras&mdash;Bapaume road with
5·9 howitzers. These combined efforts of the
<!--391.png--><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357"></a><span class="pageno">357</span>
enemy’s artillery and aircraft seemed to suggest
that, in the opinion of the Germans, the Guards
Division would be compelled, by the situation
farther north, to withdraw. Orders for a farther
withdrawal of Seymour’s Brigade were issued, and
were cancelled that evening, as the enemy made
no signs of any further attack.</p>

<p class="sidenote">March
27-29.</p>

<p>The enemy put down a heavy and accurate
barrage on our front line, in the morning of
the 27th, which lasted about an hour; in the
afternoon it died down, and no infantry attack
developed. That night the 1st Battalion was
relieved by the 1st Battalion Welsh Guards, and
went into support until the night of the 29th.
During the relief Lieutenant J. R. Nicholson and
Lieutenant W. U. Timmis were wounded.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><abbr title="March">Mar.</abbr> 30.</p>

<p>On returning to the front trenches, it found
the enemy’s machine-guns very active. At dawn
patrols were sent out 300 yards in front of the
line, and no movement on the part of the enemy
was reported. Everything was quiet until 8 <span class="sc small">A.M.</span>,
when the German artillery put down a heavy
barrage on our front trenches. This bombardment
was supplemented by Minenwerfer, and
was directed more especially against certain
points, which the enemy evidently considered
of tactical value. The barrage increased in
intensity later, and extended to the back area.
Shells fell with considerable accuracy on the
front trenches, and the whole Battalion had a
terrible time. But the Germans, with characteristic
thoroughness, were not content with this:
they thickened up their barrage with machine-gun
fire, and sent fourteen aeroplanes to drop
<!--392.png--><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358"></a><span class="pageno">358</span>
bombs behind the trenches. They not unnaturally
thought that, after three hours of a
bombardment of this kind, no one could possibly
remain to resist their infantry attack, but in
this they were mistaken. The 1st Battalion remained
unmoved. Shattered, covered with earth,
deafened by the constant explosions, dazed by
the spectacle of maimed and mutilated men, the
Grenadiers hung grimly on to their line, though
in some places the trenches were completely
obliterated.</p>

<p>Amongst the casualties at this time were
Lieutenant Harvard, who was killed by a Minenwerfer,
and Second Lieutenant Mays, who was
mortally wounded by machine-gun bullets.</p>

<p>At 10.45 <span class="sc small">A.M.</span> the enemy’s barrage lifted, and
was replaced by an intense machine-gun fire,
which swept the parapets. Under cover of this
the enemy’s attack developed, and dense masses
of men could be seen advancing. Under the
impression that the bombardment had accounted
for most of the Battalion, and had so demoralised
the survivors as to render them incapable of
resistance, the Germans determined to turn the
flank of Seymour’s Brigade, and marched up the
sunken road in close formation. They apparently
thought that by sheer weight of numbers
they could gain their object, and when they
came in sight they were met with a withering
fire which completely staggered them. To their
dismay they found that not only was the 1st
Battalion waiting for them, but that the men
were shooting coolly and accurately, in spite of the
shelling to which they had been subjected. The
<!--393.png--><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359"></a><span class="pageno">359</span>
attack was stopped, and although the Germans
suffered heavily in their ineffectual attempts to
reach our trench, they never succeeded even in
reaching the wire, except at one point opposite
<abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 2 Company. When they approached by
the sunken road in dense masses, one of their
companies was sent round the south-western
edge of the road to carry out a flanking movement,
and about fifty men succeeded in entering
into the front trench, occupied by <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 2
Company. Captain Stein immediately organised
a counter-attack, and in order to cut off any
Germans who might escape, sent Lieutenant
Corbett with a party to a position on the sunken
road, where they could fire on the Germans as
they were ejected from the trench. Meanwhile
he himself led a bombing attack down the trench
towards the sunken road. This manœuvre was
completely successful, and was undertaken with
so much rapidity and daring that the Germans
were not only quickly ejected, but fell an easy
prey to Lieutenant Corbett’s party, as they
attempted to escape down the sunken road. On
returning to the trenches, Lieutenant Corbett
was buried by a Minenwerfer, and had his leg
smashed. The German attack had been a costly
failure, and, in spite of the three hours’ bombardment
and the masses of men employed, not even a
dent had been made in the line. From a wounded
prisoner who was taken the next day it was
ascertained that the Germans had employed two
regiments (the 452nd and 453rd) in this attack,
each having one battalion in the front line, while
a third regiment was to exploit the attack if
<!--394.png--><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360"></a><span class="pageno">360</span>
successful. Although the infantry attack was
effectually arrested, the enemy maintained a
heavy machine-gun and rifle fire until it was
dark, probably with the intention of preventing
patrols following them up, and also to enable
them to clear their wounded.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><abbr title="March">Mar.</abbr> 31.</p>

<p>The casualties in the 1st Battalion were
remarkably small, amounting to 80, with two
officers killed and one wounded. The men were
all dead beat after these strenuous days in the
trenches, and they had to remain for another
twenty-four hours in the front line. Lieutenant
Vernon came up to command <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 4 Company,
and Second Lieutenant Webber joined <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 3
Company. The next day passed uneventfully
except for a certain amount of shelling. Captain
Malcolm was sent up to take command of the
King’s Company.</p>

<p>On January 1 the 2nd Battalion marched from
Berneville to Arras, and went into good billets in
Levis Barracks. Second Lieutenant J. S. Carter
and Second Lieutenant the <abbr title="Honorable">Hon.</abbr> S. A. S. Montagu
arrived on the 8th. On the 9th the
Battalion went into the line for a tour of sixteen
days, spending alternately four days in the front
trenches and four days in support. The frontage
allotted to the Battalion was astride the River
Scarpe, with one company in the village of
Roeux on the north side, and the remaining three
companies on the south side of the river. In
many ways the line was convenient, for there
was a light railway as well as a canal, which
facilitated the bringing up of troops and rations
to within a mile of the line. There were also
cook-houses, where hot meals could be cooked,
<!--396.png--><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362"></a><span class="pageno">362</span>
and conveyed thence in hot food containers to
the line. Above all, there was a continuous
line of communication throughout the Battalion
area; on the other hand, the trenches had been
neglected, and in places were unrevetted. During
the first four days spent in the front line nothing
of importance occurred, although there were a
few casualties caused by shell-fire. Colonel Lord
Ardee assumed command of the 1st Guards
Brigade, replacing Colonel Follett, who had been
in command while Brigadier-General de Crespigny
was on leave. Rain fell almost unceasingly
during the four days spent in support, and the
trenches became so impassable that the men had
to work day and night to make them habitable.
On the 17th <abbr title="Lieutenant">Lieut.</abbr>-Colonel Rasch went on a
month’s leave, and Major the <abbr title="Honorable">Hon.</abbr> W. Bailey
took over the command with Captain Harcourt-Vernon
as second in command. The four days
in the front line from the 17th to the 21st were
unusually quiet, and the Germans confined themselves
to spasmodic bombardments by trench
mortars at dusk and at dawn. On the 19th the
Corps Commander, <abbr title="Lieutenant">Lieut.</abbr>-General Sir Charles Fergusson
(an old Grenadier), visited the Battalion.
During the following days spent in support, there
was a heavy bombardment with gas-shells, and
when the next tour of duty in the front line came,
the railway was subjected to heavy shelling.
Several gas-shells fell among <abbr title="Numbers">Nos.</abbr> 2 and 4 Companies,
which were waiting to entrain, but owing
to good gas discipline the casualties were slight,
the chief injuries being caused to men who were
splashed with liquid from the exploding shells.
<!--397.png--><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363"></a><span class="pageno">363</span>
Several men had to be sent to hospital suffering
from the effects of gas, and Lieutenant M. H.
Ponsonby was sent home for the same reason.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><abbr title="February">Feb.</abbr></p>

<p>Owing to the formation of the 4th Guards
Brigade in the Thirty-first Division, the Guards
Divisional frontage was readjusted, and each
Brigade, now consisting of only three battalions,
had one battalion in the front line, one in support,
and one in reserve, the latter usually in Arras.
The 2nd Battalion was in support from the 2nd
to the 5th, and was chiefly employed on fatigues,
digging out forward trenches, and carrying up
wire and duckboards. On the 6th it moved
into the front line, when it had a few casualties.
After four days in reserve at Arras it returned
to the support line, and was again occupied in
improving and strengthening the trenches. On
the 14th Second Lieutenant A. P. J. M. P. de
Lisle joined from the Reinforcement Battalion.
Rumours of a coming German offensive reached
the Division, and Staff Officers came from all
directions, while new trenches in unexpected
places sprang up every night. On the 22nd the
Battalion went into reserve, and spent the following
days resting in Gordon Camp.</p>

<p class="sidenote">March.</p>

<p>On March 6 a raid was carried out by the
2nd Battalion. While it was in the support
line, Major Bailey had been told that the Battalion
would be required to carry out a raid when
it went up into the front line, as the Intelligence
Branch of the Headquarters Staff was anxious
to obtain information with regard to the coming
German offensive. The place selected for the
raid was opposite the extreme left of the Battalion
<!--398.png--><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364"></a><span class="pageno">364</span>
frontage, and had been chosen partly because the
aeroplane photographs showed that the enemy
was thinner there than elsewhere, and partly on
account of some rising ground on the left which
would give partial protection from machine-gun
fire. In the original scheme a silent raid by
twenty-four men under Lieutenant Palmer was
proposed, but this was altered later to a raid
on a larger scale with an artillery and trench
mortar barrage. In addition to the twenty-four
men from <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 2 Company, eight volunteers from
the other three companies were called for, and
the whole party proceeded to Gordon Camp
under Lieutenant Clarke, with Captain Browning,
who was an old hand at raids, to supervise
their training. Meanwhile a great deal of valuable
reconnaissance and preparation was carried
out from the front line by Captain O. M. Smith,
commanding <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 2 Company. Unfortunately
during the few days before the raid the visibility
was good, and therefore unfavourable for such
operations, since the greater part of the wire-cutting
had to be postponed until the day before
the raid took place. In order to deceive the
enemy as to the actual place selected for the
raid, wire-cutting was carried out at different
places along the whole Divisional frontage.</p>

<p>The night of the raid proved to be fine and
bright. The raiders were brought up from
Gordon Camp in buses, and, after an issue of
rum at advanced Battalion Headquarters, formed
up on a tape in No Man’s Land about 150 yards
from the enemy’s trench (the total distance
between the opposing trench lines being 240
<!--399.png--><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365"></a><span class="pageno">365</span>
yards). At zero hour, 2.40 <span class="sc small">A.M.</span>, our artillery
put down a barrage on the German front trenches
for one minute, and then lifted it on to the support
trenches, where it was maintained during the
raid. At the same time two separate barrages
were dropped on either flank, while suspected
saps, machine-guns, and communication trenches
had a standing barrage of Newton trench mortars
and howitzers directed on them. The raiders
were divided into three parties: the right and
left parties, each consisting of a sergeant and
eight men, entered the enemy trench simultaneously
and immediately wheeled outwards.
The centre party, consisting of Lieutenant Clarke
himself, a sergeant, two stretcher-bearers, and five
men, remained at the point of entry. The orders
were that the raid was not to last more than
twenty minutes, and the raiders were to withdraw
as soon as a prisoner had been captured. In
order to confuse the enemy great quantities of
coloured lights were sent up along the whole
Divisional front. The enemy were completely
taken by surprise, although, as subsequent examination
of the prisoners proved, they had been
warned of the possibility of a raid. The right
and left parties had not gone far before they
came upon several small shelters containing
Germans. These were at once bombed and two
prisoners were quickly captured. At the same
time a machine-gun mounted on the parapet was
taken, and the team bayoneted. The gun itself
was carried back to our lines by Private Marshal
of <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 1 Company. Lieutenant Clarke at once
ordered a withdrawal, as the object of the raid
<!--400.png--><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366"></a><span class="pageno">366</span>
had been accomplished, and the whole party
returned safely with its two prisoners and
machine-gun, having been away for only twelve
minutes. Somewhat later the enemy retaliated
with machine-guns, trench mortars, and artillery,
but caused no casualties, and finally the shelling
on both sides died down completely. The
prisoners were identified as belonging to the 10th
Imperial Bavarian Regiment; one was a machine-gunner
and the other an orderly. A certain
amount of useful information was elicited, but
their knowledge was naturally only local.</p>

<p>With the exception of this raid, nothing of
importance occurred at the beginning of March,
until on the 12th Second Lieutenant G. H.
Hanning and Second Lieutenant H. M. Chapman
were both wounded by the same shell. Fortunately
they were close to a dressing-station, and
were in the doctor’s hands within ten minutes.
On the 13th an attack was expected, and our
artillery fired continual bursts of harassing fire
which brought retaliation from the Germans,
during which one sergeant and three men were
wounded. The four days from the 14th to the
18th were spent in the line, but proved uneventful,
and on the 20th the 2nd Battalion retired to
Arras. Next day rumours of a successful German
offensive on a large front reached the Battalion,
but nothing definite was known. Shells fell in
Arras, causing many casualties, and the town
began to be cleared of its inhabitants. On the
22nd Lieutenant P. V. Pelly and fifty men who
had been transferred from the Household Battalion
joined from the Reinforcement Battalion.</p>

<p><!--401.png--><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367"></a><span class="pageno">367</span>
Further disquieting rumours with regard to the
German advance were repeated from mouth to
mouth, and became so exaggerated that drastic
and often unnecessary measures were taken to
prevent any stores from falling into the hands
of the Germans.</p>

<p>On the 24th preparations were made to relieve
the 1st Battalion Scots Guards in the Army line,
from <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Leger running north towards Henin,
but in the afternoon these instructions were
cancelled. It appeared that the enemy had
taken Gomiecourt, and was advancing towards
Courcelles. <abbr title="Lieutenant">Lieut.</abbr>-Colonel Rasch received orders
to take up an outpost line on the high ground
south-west of Boiry, and went off at once with
the Company Commanders, to reconnoitre the
ground and settle the boundaries.</p>

<p>All four companies were placed in the front
line and told to find their own supports, but two
platoons of <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 1 Company were kept in Battalion
reserve. The line of resistance was just
on the forward crest of a slope. Patrols were at
once sent out, and reported the presence of several
units of the Thirty-first Division, still holding the
line in front of the Battalion. In the early
morning troops were observed moving southward
across the front, and these proved to be units of
the Thirty-first Division, who had received their
orders too late to withdraw under cover of the
darkness. Later in the morning the 2nd Guards
Brigade appeared on the right with orders to dig
a line, in continuation of that held by the 2nd Battalion,
and to cover the retirement of the rest
of the Thirty-first Division. The remainder of
the Guards Division had had to conform to the
retirement on the right, by withdrawing during
the night to a line which prolonged to the left
the new position taken up by the 2nd Battalion,
so that at daybreak all four Guards Brigades
were in line between Boisieux-<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>-Marc and
Ayette. During the morning several battalions
of the Thirty-first Division passed through the
line on the left of the Battalion, and retired to
the rear. All the time the enemy were following
close behind, and about 7 <span class="sc small">P.M.</span> Captain Martin
Smith reported that 100 Germans could be seen
advancing on the crest of a hill in front. They
<!--403.png--><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369"></a><span class="pageno">369</span>
were preceded by machine-guns, which at once
opened fire on our advanced posts, causing a few
casualties. This advance on the part of the
enemy was, however, soon arrested by Lewis-gun
and rifle fire, and for the moment no action
developed. As soon as it was dark, patrols were
pushed out, and the trench line was wired. At
11.30 <span class="sc small">P.M.</span> that night orders were issued for De
Crespigny’s Brigade to relieve Sergison-Brooke’s
Brigade, the relief to be complete by 4.30 <span class="sc small">A.M.</span>
The 2nd Battalion relieved the 1st Battalion
Coldstream astride the Arras-Albert railway,
with <abbr title="Numbers">Nos.</abbr> 1 and 2 Companies under Captain
Browning and Captain Martin Smith on the east
side, and <abbr title="Numbers">Nos.</abbr> 3 and 4 under Lieutenant Clarke
and Captain Wilson on the west side of the
railway line. The new position was difficult
to hold, for, not only did it include three
sunken roads and a railway, but it was also
overlooked from the outskirts of Moyenneville
and from high ground all along the front, where
a number of deserted huts could give cover to
snipers and machine-guns. During the night it
was found necessary to throw back the right
of the line towards the supporting battalion,
which had to send up men to fill the gap made
on the right by the withdrawal of the Thirty-first
Division.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><abbr title="March">Mar.</abbr> 27.</p>

<p>Soon after dawn on the 27th the German
infantry appeared, and evidently intended to
continue their advance. The whole method
of attack seemed to have been altered by
the Germans. No longer did they advance in
close formation, and offer easy targets to their
<!--404.png--><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370"></a><span class="pageno">370</span>
opponents. They copied our methods, running
forward by twos and threes, until a sufficiently
strong line of men had been built up for an assault,
and all the time feeling for a weak place in the
British line. This new method was difficult to
counter in many ways, for not only was there no
target for our artillery but it entailed a great
expenditure of ammunition often with little
result. On this occasion, however, the new
German tactics were not attended with any
success, for the men of the 2nd Battalion began
shooting steadily and thinning out the enemy’s
ranks with great accuracy. The firing was soon
universal down the whole line, and the Germans
found it impossible to make any headway against
the storm of bullets. All four companies had a great
deal of shooting, but especially <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 1 under Captain
Browning, since it was afforded an opportunity
of enfilading the Germans, as they advanced
across its front. All the time the enemy’s shells
fell on the trenches, and <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 4 Company under
Captain Wilson suffered severely. Lieutenant D.
Harvey was killed by a shell, and Captain Wilson
was badly wounded. About the same time Second
Lieutenant de Lisle in <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 2 Company was also
wounded. Under the storm of shells and bullets
the men found time to bring down one of the
enemy’s aeroplanes which had ventured down
too low. The German attack did not progress in
this part of the line, and the chief thrust drifted
farther to the south opposite the 3rd Battalion
Grenadiers and the 4th Guards Brigade. Second
Lieutenant Montagu was sent from <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 3 to <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 4
Company, the latter having lost two officers.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><!--405.png--><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371"></a><span class="pageno">371</span>
<abbr title="March">Mar.</abbr> 28.</p>

<p>The next morning <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 4 Company reported
that its patrols had discovered the enemy lining
up within 100 yards of its trench; this news was
at once telephoned to our artillery, which soon
dispersed them with a wonderfully accurate
fire. During the morning <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 1 and <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 2
Companies were heavily shelled, and under cover
of this barrage and of machine-gun fire, parties
of the enemy made continual efforts to penetrate
the line, but never even succeeded in reaching
the wire. The Germans had direct observation
on the whole of our line, and their shooting was
consequently very accurate. On the other hand,
their abortive attacks over the open cost them
dearly, and their losses must have been very
heavy. In the 2nd Battalion that day there
were 22 killed and 42 wounded, among whom
was Lieutenant J. H. Jacob.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><abbr title="March">Mar.</abbr> 29.</p>

<p>The following day was quieter, as the main
German attack was made farther south, and
advantage was taken of this lull in the offensive
to relieve some of the officers in the front
line. Major the <abbr title="Honorable">Hon.</abbr> W. R. Bailey went up
to take the place of <abbr title="Lieutenant">Lieut.</abbr>-Colonel Rasch, and
Lieutenant Acland, Lieutenant Manners, Lieutenant
Lubbock, Second Lieutenant Sharpe, and
Second Lieutenant Pelly replaced Captain Martin
Smith, Second Lieutenant Carter, and Second
Lieutenant Montagu, who went down to the first
line transport for a rest. Forty other ranks
were also relieved every night in the same
way.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><abbr title="March">Mar.</abbr> 30.</p>

<p>After two hours’ very heavy shelling on the
30th, the Germans made two very determined
<!--406.png--><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372"></a><span class="pageno">372</span>
attacks on the Divisional front, but were repulsed
with heavy losses. These attacks were not
directed against the portion of the line occupied
by the 2nd Battalion, which was not therefore
engaged. Later on, however, the enemy launched
two faint-hearted attacks on the Battalion, one
up the railway, and the other west of the railway,
and about a dozen Germans succeeded in getting
a foothold in a post held by <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 3 Company, from
which most of the occupants had been blown
by shell-fire. They were promptly ejected, and
the post was re-established. Lieutenant Manners
and Second Lieutenant Langley were wounded,
and the total casualties that day were 10 killed
and 35 wounded. In the evening Lieutenant
Palmer was sent up to relieve Lieutenant Clarke.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><abbr title="March">Mar.</abbr> 31.</p>

<p>After a quiet day in the line on the 31st the
2nd Battalion was relieved by part of the 1st
Battalion Irish Guards and 2nd Battalion Coldstream
Guards, and went into Brigade Reserve,
<abbr title="Numbers">Nos.</abbr> 2 and 4 Companies in huts near Boiry <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Martin, and the remainder of the Battalion in a
camp between Heudecourt and Blairville.</p>

<p>The 3rd Battalion went into the line near
Fampoux from the 2nd to the 4th, placing
<abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 2 Company under Captain Holbech and
<abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 4 under Captain Carrington south of the River
Scarpe, with <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 3 under Captain Tufnell north of
the river, and <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 1 under Lieutenant Fitzgerald
in reserve. The front line was held by posts
which were in good order, but it was bitterly cold,
and there was snow on the ground. After two
days in support the Battalion retired to Arras for
eight days. On the 14th <abbr title="Lieutenant">Lieut.</abbr>-Colonel Thorne,
in the absence on leave of the Brigadier, took
command of the Brigade, and Major Cavendish
<!--408.png--><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374"></a><span class="pageno">374</span>
commanded the Battalion. On the 17th the
Battalion returned to the trenches. A thaw
having now set in, the trenches became mere
drains, and required a great deal of work to keep
them habitable. The four days subsequently
spent in support were made unpleasant by the
gas-shells, with which the Germans searched the
back area.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><abbr title="February">Feb.</abbr></p>

<p>After four more days in reserve the Battalion
returned to the trenches on February 1, when it
came in for a severe bombardment with gas-shells,
which caused 104 casualties; most of these
occurred while the gas-shell holes were being
filled in, as it had not been realised before that
there was any danger of gas-poisoning while
the men performed this work, and masks
were therefore not worn. After the usual four
days in support and four days in reserve, the
Battalion began another tour of duty in the
front trenches on the 15th. Patrols went out
every night under Lieutenant Bedford or Second
Lieutenant Durbin, to ascertain the effect of our
trench mortar fire on the enemy’s wire, in view
of a raid being undertaken. After four more
days in reserve the Battalion again retired to
Arras.</p>

<p class="sidenote">March.</p>

<p>The same routine was followed during the
first three weeks in March, and the days spent
in the front line proved uneventful. Rumours
of a German offensive movement became more
persistent every day, and it was perfectly clear
that in the course of the next week the enemy
would commence their great attack. Every
possible precaution was therefore taken, and the
<!--409.png--><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375"></a><span class="pageno">375</span>
men in the front line were always looking out
for any sign of hostile movement. The German
attack actually began at dawn on the 21st, when
the 3rd Battalion was in reserve at Arras. The
companies were marching off to do their training,
when several shells fell in the town, causing four
casualties in <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 1 Company. Orders were then
received that there was to be as little movement
as possible in the town, so that training was
confined to musketry and gas drill carried out in
the barrack-rooms. At 5.30 on the same evening
the Battalion was ordered to move at once to the
Mercatel area. There it remained the next day,
ready to move at a moment’s notice, and the
Company Commanders took advantage of this

<p>At 3 <span class="sc small">A.M.</span> on the 23rd <abbr title="Lieutenant">Lieut.</abbr>-Colonel Thorne
received verbal orders to bring up the Battalion
at once, and to relieve the remnants of the 93rd
Brigade in the line, but on reaching Boyelles he
found that this Brigade had only just taken
over the line and required no relief. He therefore
withdrew the front companies, <abbr title="Numbers">Nos.</abbr> 1 and 4,
and placed them in the support trenches, occupied
by the West Yorkshire Regiment, which
consequently had to retire into reserve. This
manœuvre was carried out under heavy shelling,
during which Lieutenant Seymour was wounded.
That evening <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 2 Company under Captain
Holbech and <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 3 under Lieutenant Pauling
went up into the front trenches, the remainder
of the Battalion being in support. The next
day these two companies moved back from the
railway cutting, which was being heavily shelled,
and occupied the support trenches. The Germans
could be seen advancing by twos and threes
with the object of forming a sufficiently strong
line to attack, but they were scattered by our
rifle fire before they could complete the assembly.
At night patrols were sent out to obtain identifications
but were not successful, since the enemy
had had time to remove their dead and wounded.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><!--411.png--><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377"></a><span class="pageno">377</span>
<abbr title="March">Mar.</abbr> 25.</p>

<p>It was reported that Ervillers had been taken
by the Germans; and there seemed every probability
that the line held by the Guards Division
would have to be withdrawn. A retirement
to the Adinfer line being shortly expected, one
officer per company was sent back to reconnoitre
these trenches. There was little doubt
that the Germans were massing their men in
front of the line held by the 3rd Battalion, and
Lieutenant Pauling reported that they were
dug in not fifty yards away, dressed in pack
order. The men were quite confident in their
ability to stop any advance on the enemy’s part,
but it was essential that the Guards Division
should conform to the movements of the other
troops in the line. At 10 <span class="sc small">P.M.</span> orders were
received cancelling all previous ones, and instructing
the Battalion to retire to a new line not yet
dug. The withdrawal was carried out without
hurry, companies retiring at half-hour intervals,
and the Lewis-gun sections remaining till the
end. The new trench line, composed of slits only,
was at once begun, and was completed by the
next morning. During the withdrawal Lieutenant
Pauling and Second Lieutenant Durbin were
killed by the same shell. They were both first-rate
officers who could be ill spared, the former
having already gained the Military Cross.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><abbr title="March">Mar.</abbr> 26.</p>

<p>Nothing of importance occurred during the
26th, although the Germans were seen in large
parties in Hamelincourt and Moyenneville. All
day shells continued to fall, but no infantry
attack developed.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><abbr title="March">Mar.</abbr> 27.</p>

<p>On the 27th the 3rd Battalion was relieved by
<!--412.png--><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378"></a><span class="pageno">378</span>
the 2nd Battalion Coldstream Guards, and went
into Divisional support, where it took up a
position in an old German line on the ridge
just south of Boiry <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Rictude with all four
companies in the line. At 11 <span class="sc small">A.M.</span> the East
Yorkshire Regiment, which was in the front line,
was attacked by Germans in mass formation,
but held its ground. The enemy, however, was
able to creep round in rear and cut it off. This
movement placed the 2nd Battalion Irish Guards,
on the right, in a perilous position, and forced it
to retire. All the time the German artillery
shelled the back area, and particularly the valley
in which the 3rd Battalion Headquarters was
situated. As the East Yorkshire Regiment also
retired, the trenches held by the Battalion
became the front line. The Germans now determined
to pursue their success, and advanced
with confidence towards <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 2 Company, but
were met with an accurate and steady fire from
the Lewis and machine guns, which staggered
them and decimated their ranks. The fighting
became general all along the line, but although
the Germans fought with great courage they
were unable to make any impression on the
Battalion frontage. The casualties among our
officers were very high, Captain Parker and
Second Lieutenant Van Ranney receiving severe
wounds from which they never recovered. Captain
Carrington, Lieutenant Knollys, Second Lieutenant
Bennett, Second Lieutenant Tate, and Lieutenant
Fish, the American Medical Officer, were
wounded. Among other ranks the casualties were
30 killed, 90 wounded, and 4 missing. The attack
<!--413.png--><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379"></a><span class="pageno">379</span>
now drifted down towards the right, where the
4th Guards Brigade was posted, and the German
troops opposed to the 3rd Battalion did not
appear to be anxious to renew their attack.
That night a somewhat complicated relief took
place. <abbr title="Numbers">Nos.</abbr> 3 and 4 Companies were relieved by
two companies of the 13th Battalion of the York
and Lancaster Regiment; <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 3 passing into
support, and <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 4 relieving another company of
the York and Lancaster Regiment which prolonged
the line to the right, and took the place
of <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 2 Company. Just before dawn <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 3
Company moved up to get touch with the 2nd
Battalion Coldstream Guards, and placed three
platoons in the front line with one in support.
All these moves were successfully accomplished
by daybreak.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><abbr title="March">Mar.</abbr> 28.</p>

<p>Although the Germans had lost very heavily
in their attack on the 27th, they had not abandoned
the idea of forcing back that part of the
line. Early the next morning a heavy barrage
was put down by the enemy on our trenches, and
soon afterwards a force of about 200 Germans
attacked <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 4 Company and the 13th Battalion
York and Lancaster Regiment in four waves.
So determined was this attack that the Germans
succeeded in getting into the posts in the front
line. Lieutenant Fitzgerald, who was in command
of <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 4 Company, quickly organised a
counter-attack from the support platoon of the
York and Lancaster Regiment, and, having
launched this, organised a second counter-attack
from the platoon in support of his own Company,
which he led himself. These counter-attacks
<!--414.png--><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380"></a><span class="pageno">380</span>
were completely successful, and ejected the enemy,
who made haste to retire some 400 yards. In
order to ensure the stopping of the German
attack, should it succeed, Captain Holbech had
in the meantime made a strong point in rear
of <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 4 Company. Another bombardment by
the enemy seemed to indicate the imminence of
a further attack, but the evening passed off
quietly, the shelling being merely the fringe of
the barrage, put down by the enemy farther to
the right. There were further casualties among
the officers: Lieutenant Orriss was mortally
wounded, and Second Lieutenant Ellison was also
wounded.</p>

<p class="sidenote">March 29-31.</p>

<p>The 3rd Battalion was then relieved by the
1st Battalion Scots Guards, and went into Brigade
Reserve. <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 3 Company remained in slits along
the ridge during the day of the 29th, but was
withdrawn at night. On the 30th the 3rd
Battalion returned to the front line, but except
for a certain amount of shelling nothing of importance
took place.</p>

<p>On January 1 the 4th Battalion went by train
to Athies, and moved into the support line with
three Companies near Northumberland Lane, and
one Company attached to the 1st Battalion
Grenadier Guards. <abbr title="Lieutenant">Lieut.</abbr>-Colonel Pilcher was
at the time on leave, and the Battalion was
commanded by Major Walker. On the 5th
three Companies were moved up into the front
trenches with one Company in reserve. On the
following day Company Sergeant-Major W.
Stretton, Lance-Sergeant C. Hatton, and Lance-Corporal
W. Long, all non-commissioned officers
of great gallantry and experience, were killed by
a Grenatenwerfer, while Captain Layton of the
same Company was wounded. There was a hard
frost followed by a heavy fall of snow, and a
German mistaking his way in the snowstorm
<!--416.png--><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382"></a><span class="pageno">382</span>
walked into our lines, and was taken prisoner.
On the 9th the 4th Battalion was relieved by the
1st Battalion, and retired into the support line,
where it remained till the 13th.</p>

<p>A thaw now began and caused much damage
to the trenches in many places, especially where
they were not revetted. The following officers
joined the Battalion: Lieutenant T. W. Minchin,
<abbr title="Distinguished Service Order">D.S.O.</abbr>, Lieutenant M. D. Thomas, Second Lieutenant
M. P. B. Wrixon, and Second Lieutenant
R. M. Meikle. The four days spent in the front
line from the 13th to the 17th were a time of hard
frost, followed by a thaw, which made the trenches
almost impassable. The enemy sent over a
large number of gas-shells, but thanks to the
masks there were no casualties. The Battalion
was relieved by the 3rd Battalion Grenadier
Guards, and marched to Fampoux, where it entrained
for Arras. There it was placed in billets
in the prison, with Battalion Headquarters in
the Rue Gaugières. On the 25th it was sent
up as support Battalion to the right sector, and
came in for a heavy bombardment of gas-shells.
The trenches were now in a deplorable condition,
and constant fatigue parties had to be supplied
for their improvement.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><abbr title="February">Feb.</abbr></p>

<p>On the night of February 2 a successful raid
was carried out by Seymour’s Brigade, and four
prisoners were captured, but with this exception
there was little activity in the front line, and
the work of repairing the trenches was proceeded
with unmolested. On the 5th the Battalion
again retired to Arras for a week’s rest, and
occupied its old billets. The Battalion transport,
<!--417.png--><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383"></a><span class="pageno">383</span>
inspected by the Brigadier, was reported to be
the best in the whole Division, and Second Lieutenant
Selby-Lowndes, the transport officer, received
great credit for its high state of efficiency.</p>

<p>A decrease in the supply of men for the Army
made it necessary to reduce the fighting strength
of divisions, and it was therefore decided to
reduce each brigade in the Army by one battalion.
A new Brigade, consisting of the 4th Battalion
Grenadier Guards, 3rd Battalion Coldstream
Guards, and 2nd Battalion Irish Guards, was
therefore formed and placed under the command
of Brigadier-General Lord Ardee. It was with
much regret that these Battalions had to leave
the Guards Division, in which they had fought for
so long. Major-General Feilding sent the following
message to <abbr title="Lieutenant">Lieut.</abbr>-Colonel Pilcher:</p>

<p class="blockquote">I cannot tell you how sad I am that your Battalion
should have to leave my Division. Throughout the time
that the Battalion has been under my command it has
maintained the great traditions of the Brigade of Guards.</p>

<p class="blockquote">Formed as it was during the war, it was able at once
to take its place equal in efficiency and smartness to any
Battalion in the Division. It has been a great grief to
me that I have not been able to be present to bid you
farewell and thank all ranks for their services, and wish
you all good luck in the future.</p>
